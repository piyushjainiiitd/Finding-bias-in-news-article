BACKING THE Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) with some riders, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray Wednesday said that there is no need to pass a resolution against the legislation in the state Assembly, as the law will give citizenship and not to remove anyone from the country. He also reiterated he will not allow implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state as it would “impact people of all religions”.

In the third and last part of his interview to Saamana, the mouthpiece of Shiv Sena, Uddhav said there were “misunderstandings” about CAA that needed to be cleared. “CAA is not a law to remove someone from the country. (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah has said that it is to give citizenship. And I agree with him to that extent,” he added.

Asked if Maharashtra would pass a resolution against CAA, Uddhav said, “There is no need. Because CAA is not to remove anyone but to include the Hindu minorities from neighbouring countries.” The statement comes against the backdrop of all states ruled by the Congress — Sena’s ally in Maharashtra — being asked to pass a resolution against CAA in the state Assembly.

“When they come here, will they get homes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana? What about employment and education of their children? All these issues are important and we have the right to know,” he said in the interview to Saamana’s executive editor and Sena MP Sanjay Raut. Uddhav, however, criticised the NRC, saying that it will question the roots of people belonging to all religions, including Hindus. “It is not that NRC is troublesome for only Muslims. In fact, NRC will not come. We will not let it come. If BJP decides to implement NRC, it will create problems not only for Muslims but for all of us, Hindus and the people from all religions,” he said.

The CM also took a veiled dig at the Centre’s decision to give the Padma Shri award to Pakistani-origin musician Adnan Sami. “A migrant is a migrant. You can’t honour him with the Padma award…,” he said without naming anyone.

On the Centre for transferring the probe into the Koregaon Bhima violence case to NIA, Uddhav expressed “surprise”, saying the state should have been taken into confidence. “I don’t see anything wrong in it but it is surprising. They should have reviewed the matter… Doesn’t the Centre trust the state’s investigating agencies. Due to such incidents, there is a problem in Centre-state relations,” he said.

“NCP chief Sharad Pawar expressed his opinion about setting up an SIT to probe the case. But we didn’t take an immediate decision. The Centre should have also asked Pawar why he wants a re-investigation…,” he added.

On removing Pakistani and Bangladeshi “infiltrators”, Uddhav said that like demonetisation, the government is making the entire country stand in queue for a few illegal immigrants. “This government has a strange policy of always keeping people in tension,” he added.

Uddhav also accused the BJP of “betraying” him and said his ‘Hindutva’ ideology was different from that the BJP, as he did not want an unstable ‘Hindu Rashtra’ where governments are toppled and there is communal tension.
