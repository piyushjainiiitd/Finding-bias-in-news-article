“Since 1993 my books on contemporary issues have been published in every book fair, which reflects my views, thinkings, opinions everything. This year the people’s movement against CAA, NPR and NRC prompted me to chronicle my views which salute the uprising against divisive politics,” she wrote in the book.

Another book of poems by Banerjee, which touches on contemporary issues, had also been sold out, Dey said.

With 14 new titles released in this book fair, the number of books written by Banerjee has crossed 100.

Now she is the author of 102 books written mainly in Bengali and English. While Banerjee also has books of Urdu poems to her credit, her poetries were also translated to Alchiki, the language of the Santhals.

At the Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s (VHP) stall number 370, over 6,000 booklets on the benefits of the CAA have been sold till Saturday, the person manning the stall said.

The booklet said the amended citizenship law would provide Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The VHP stall had also stocked titles on the Ram Mandir issue in Ayodhya and the need for scrapping the Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.

“Both the books are also nominally priced and were in high demand,” he said.
