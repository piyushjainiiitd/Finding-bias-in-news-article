The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has selected Bhubaneshwar Kalita as the party's candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha election in Assam.

The elections for three Rajya Sabha seats in Assam will be held on March 26.

Out of the three seats, two were left vacant after Kalita and Sanjay Singh joined the BJP after quitting Congress. The third seat has been left vacant due to completion of BPF leader Biswajit Daimary's term.

Daimary on Wednesday submitted his nomination papers before returning officer for the Rajya Sabha elections as joint candidate of BJP, BPF and AGP.

He was accompanied by Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, his cabinet colleagues Himanta Biswa Sarma, AGP president and Assam minister Atul Bora, Bodoland Territorial Council Chief Hagrama Mahilary and Assam BJP unit president Ranjeet Kumar Dass.

Meanwhile, the opposition Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) on Wednesday have decided to support veteran journalist Ajit Kumar Bhuyan for one of the three Rajya Sabha seats.

Bhuyan has been vocal against the Citizenship Amendment Act passed by the government.
