Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday claimed that "many" Congress MLAs in the state would join the saffron party soon. The Assam minister claimed that Congress MLA from Barak Valley Rajdeep Gowala and some other party legislators want to switch over to the BJP.

Himanta Biswa Sarma claimed that some of the MLAs from the Congress are not happy about the party's alliance with Badruddin Ajmal-led All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF).

"Congress MLA Rajdeep Gowala has decided to join the BJP and he is the chairman of public accounts committee and two times MLA. He will be joining the BJP at any point in time. Few more MLAs want to join the BJP because they are frustrated and angry over the alliance between the Congress and the AIUDF. I am expecting a good number of people from Congress will join the BJP soon," Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

"Congress party has a habit of setting self goals. By aligning with AIUDF in Assam, Congress has finished itself for the next 50 or 100 years," the Assam minister said.

The Congress and the AIUDF have jointly put a common candidate for the Rajya Sabha election for three seats in Assam.

Reacting over the alliance with AIUDF, former Assam Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Tarun Gogoi said the coalition between the Congress and AIUDF will remain till 2021.

"We are always against the divisive power and we are extending our cooperation to all the forces who believe in democracy, secularism and those who are against the divisive forces. We will jointly fight against this communal force," Tarun Gogoi said.

AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal, too, said that the alliance between his party and the Congress would continue in future. "The alliance will be continued in 2021 and in 2024 also," Ajmal said.
