An unidentified gunman on Saturday opened fire in New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh area, where protests have continued against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). No injuries have been reported in the incident.

The gunman has been nabbed by the Delhi police, persons familiar with the development said.

The episode comes just two days after a gunman, a juvenile, opened fire in Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia, injuring one of the protestors. Last month, another man with a gun was detained by the Delhi police at Shaheen Bagh.

The police has tightened security in and around the sensitive area.

The episode comes on the heels of senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Anurag Thakur’s incendiary statements at an election rally in Delhi.
