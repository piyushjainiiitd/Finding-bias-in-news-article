Citing many issues in which the State has not received support, from the Mahadayi water dispute to flood relief and devolution of funds, former Minister and Congress leader U.T. Khader on Saturday alleged that the Centre was treating Karnataka as an “enemy”.

Speaking to presspersons here, he said the State had got a raw deal despite electing 25 BJP members to the Lok Sabha and having three Ministers in the Union Cabinet. “The budget document announced ₹18,600 crore for suburban railway in Bengaluru. But ultimately, the amount earmarked for the project is ₹1 crore. How can any BJP leader justify this?” he asked.

He also came down heavily on the State police for registering a sedition case over the staging of a skit at a school in Bidar. “In contrast, they did not act when a school in Kalladka in Dakshina Kannada exhibited a dance-drama depicting the demolition of Babri Masjid. I understand that the police are under pressure. But they should uphold professional ethics,” he said.

‘BJP leaders afraid’

Meanwhile, former Minister D.K. Shivakumar said BJP leaders have kept quiet despite the “grave injustice done to Karnataka” out fear of the party high command. He demanded to know what had happened to the notification of the Mahadayi tribunal verdict and how the promised railway coach factory at Kolar had been downgraded to a composite workshop.

He also said having a large number of MPs from BJP had only made things worse for Karnataka.
