Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday sent out a tweet congratulating Jyotiraditya Scindia for his nomination to the Rajya Sabha, on the same day Scindia joined the BJP. However, Chouhan deleted the tweet within minutes followed by the BJP officially releasing a list of all of its nine RS candidates along with 2 candidates from allied parties.

Earlier in the day, Shivraj Singh Chouhan took to the micro-blogging website Twitter and welcomed Jyotiraditya Scindia to the party with a tweet saying, "Swagat hai Maharaj, Sath hai Shivraj," which essentially translates to 'welcome your majesty, Shivraj is with you'. The reference, here, is to Scindia's lineage.

A former four-time Member of Parliament (MP) from Guna, Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from the Congress party on Tuesday, hours after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah at the PMâ€™s residence on 7, Lok Kalyan Marg in Delhi. He was inducted into the BJP in the presence of national party president JP Nadda at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi on Wednesday.
