As per the Election Commission (EC), the voter turnout for Delhi polls held on February 8 was 62.59 percent, Delhi CEO Ranbir Singh said at a press conference on February 9.

Singh added that the voter turnout in the 2015 Assembly polls had been 67.12 percent.

As per EC, the highest turnout (71.6 percent) was recorded in Ballimaran constituency while the lowest with 45.4 percent was the Delhi Cantonment constituency.

The male-female ratio was fairly balanced as 62.62 percent male voters and 62.55 percent female voters cast their votes on February 8.

Following the polling in the national capital, exit polls on February 8 predicted that this election would come as an easy win for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The AAP's election campaign this time revolved around development- healthcare, education, and other such issues, as opposed to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that ran an aggressive campaign centred around the issues of anti-CAA protests and nationalism.

Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said it is 'absolutely shocking' that the poll panel was not releasing the figure several hours after polling got over.

"Absolutely shocking. What is EC doing? Why are they not releasing poll turnout figures, several hours after polling?" Kejriwal tweeted.
