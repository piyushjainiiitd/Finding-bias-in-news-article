The Civil Aviati­on Author­ity (CAA) has set an outsta­nding exampl­e of minimu­m wage for its contra­cted janito­rs.

KARACHI: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has set an outstanding example of minimum wage for its contracted janitors. Citizens for Equal Rights, a citizens’ group that pushed the case for minimum wage for CAA janitors, would like to thank and appreciate the CAA for the praiseworthy action of raising their contracted janitors’ salaries from Rs15,000 to Rs25,000.

It is ironic that many state organisations continue to pay illegal – less than minimum wage as defined by the law – to their contracted janitors. There are municipal bodies that still continue to pay illegal, inhumane and exploitative salaries amounting to Rs12,000 per month to their contracted janitors, which is a case in point. We hope that they too will follow the CAA’s example and put an immediate end to this cruelty and modern-day slavery.
