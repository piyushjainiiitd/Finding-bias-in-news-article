In what could be termed as a heartwarming act of humanity, the protesters at Shaheen Bagh opened the road at the protest venue, letting a Hindu funeral procession pass smoothly.



In a video, which has gone viral since morning, the protesters can be seen removing barricades for the funeral procession of a Hindu person to pass.

The protesters, however, said that there was nothing unusual about the incident and it was done out of mutual respect.

Speaking on the issue, a protester said, "We respect each other and by allowing the procession to pass through, we have not done anything unusual. We have allowed buses and ambulances also." The gesture won several hearts even on social media.

Even as politicians are making controversial statements against the women of Shaheen Bagh at the protest sight, the enthusiasm remains the same.

The area had lately gained nationwide attention due to a continued anti-CAA sit-in by people, especially Muslim women against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register and National Register of Citizens.
