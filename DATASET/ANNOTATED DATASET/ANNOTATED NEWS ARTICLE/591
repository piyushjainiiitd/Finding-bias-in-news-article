Members of the Opposition Congress and the ruling BJP government indulged in a round of heated arguments in the Gujarat Assembly, on Monday, over resignations of five Congress MLAs just ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections for four seats. While Congress members alleged BJP of buying out the five MLAs, BJP members led by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that the Opposition party should not blame the ruling party for not being able to keep its flock together.

After the Question Hour, Speaker Rajendra Trivedi had declared the names of five Congress MLAs ‚Äî Pravin Maru, Pradhyumansinh Jadeja, JV Kakadia, Somabhai Patel and Mangal Gavit ‚Äî who had resigned. However, the names had become public on Sunday.

The war of words between the two sides began as soon as the Question Hour began, as the first listed question was that of Pravin Maru. As the Speaker called out ‚ÄòQuestion One‚Äô, Congress MLA Virji Thummar, followed by other Congress MLAs, said, ‚ÄúMaal vechai gayo (This commodity has been sold out).‚Äù

This was objected by treasury benches and Minister of State for Home, Pradeepsinh Jadeja said that it was not proper to call any member of the House as ‚ÄòMaal (Commodity)‚Äô.

Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that Opposition Congress could not keep its flock together and is unnecessarily blaming the ruling party for the same.

At one point, Gujarat Cong-ress chief and senior legislator Amit Chavda cited a local newspaper report and alleged that BJP had bought four Congress MLAs at Rs 65 crore. The allegation was strongly objected by BJP members, including CM Rupani who said that the ruling party has never done any corruption.

Refusing the allegations leveled by Opposition members, Gujarat BJP chief and Bhavnagar MLA Jitu Vaghani alleged that the resignations of Congress MLAs was the result of an internal fight between two senior Congress leaders. He further alleged that even during the voting for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections, there will be cross-voting from Congress MLAs over the issue.
