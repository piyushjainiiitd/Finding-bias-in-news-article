Paramount Pictures has set Ron Howard to direct The Fixer, a Tyler Hisel script that tells the true story of a disgraced FBI agent, who at the height of the Cold War, is tapped by the CIA to lead a ragtag team of CIA operatives and Chicago mobsters on an unlikely mission to try to assassinate Fidel Castro.

The pic is produced by Imagine’s Brian Grazer, Joint Effort’s Bradley Cooper & Todd Phillips, and Andrew Panay.

Howard most recently wrapped an adaptation of the JD Vance novel Hillbilly Elegy for Netflix, starring Amy Adams Haley Bennett, Glenn Close, Freida Pinto and Gabriel Basso.

Howard is repped by CAA. Hisel is with Alexander Robb of Insignia Entertainment and attorney Robert Szymanski of Eclipse Law.
