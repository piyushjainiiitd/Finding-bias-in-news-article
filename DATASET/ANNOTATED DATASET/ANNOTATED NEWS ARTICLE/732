The Edge

WITH THE Parliament session getting underway, competitive politics being played out between the Congress and the Left in Kerala over CAA-NPR-NRC has shifted to Delhi. But the Left is at a disadvantage since it has no prominent faces in Parliament now. Its numbers too have come down sharply. On the opening day, the Congress managed to hit the headlines when its MPs protested in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Parliament complex and wore black bands inside when the President delivered his address. But CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who is not an MP, reached Parliament and joined Congress‚Äôs Ghulam Nabi Azad and other leaders when they addressed a press conference in Parliament. And while Congress MP from Kerala T N Prathapan wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker, seeking the disqualification of Anurag Thakur, Left MPs from Kerala K K Ragesh and K Somaprasad visited Shaheen Bagh on Sunday.

The Replacement

GOPAL BAGLAY, who is joint secretary in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, is headed to Colombo as India‚Äôs envoy. An IFS officer, he has been deputy high commissioner to Pakistan and was also joint secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) in the Ministry of External Affairs, apart from holding the ministry‚Äôs spokesperson‚Äôs job for a brief period of time. He will replace India‚Äôs envoy to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu, who is going to be India‚Äôs envoy to the US.
