As the public debate over the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the Constitution of India continues across the nation, the Karnataka Legislative Assembly has decided to set aside two days – March 2 and 3 – for a special discussion on the significance of the Constitution and extent to which it has succeeded in meeting aspirations of people in the last 70 years.

Assembly Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri told mediapersons on Friday that the Assembly would act as a platform for legislators to speak about the relevance of the Constitution. He held a round of discussion with senior legislators and they have expressed willingness to participate in the debate. More details of the discussion would be worked out in the next few days after a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee of the House on February 18, Mr. Kageri said.

Asked whether it would be possible to have discussions above partisan politics on the Constitution in the present scenario, Mr. Kageri said: “I have appealed to members that they should discuss the Constitution beyond their political prism.” Each member will speak on a particular topic of the Constitution, he said.

On a question whether the Assembly would a pass a resolution on CAA after the discussion, the Speaker said there was no such proposal before him.

Mr. Kageri said he had planned to hold a conference on the Constitution in November last but the programme was cancelled owing to bypolls to 15 Legislative Assembly constituencies.

Governor Vajubhai Vala will address the joint session of the State legislature on Monday at 11 a.m. The House will discuss the vote on the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address till February 20. The House will be adjourned on February 20 for meeting again on March 2 and it will conclude on March 31.

Mr. Kageri said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who also holds the Finance Minister portfolio, will present the State budget on March 5.
