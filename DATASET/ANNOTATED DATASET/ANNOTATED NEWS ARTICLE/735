After a group of women protesting against the new citizenship law and proposed NRC in Old Lucknow area alleged that police took away their blankets on Saturday night, police on Sunday said the blankets were seized in a ‚Äúlegal manner‚Äù to avoid any law and order problem.

Meanwhile, an FIR has been registered against unidentified people for ‚Äúviolating Section 144 of the CrPC‚Äù. Police termed the sit-in illegal, saying no protest was allowed in Ghantaghar as per Allahabad High Court‚Äôs order.

A statement issued by Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Lucknow) Vikas Chandra Tripathi said that the blankets were removed as some organisations were trying to distribute them as a result of which even those who were not a part of the protest came to take the blankets.

‚ÄúDuring the illegal protest at Ghantaghar park (in Old Lucknow), some people were trying to make a temporary barricading with ropes and sticks and were spreading sheets. They were stopped from doing so. Members of some organisations brought blankets and were distributing them. As a result, several people who were not part of the protest came in large numbers to take the blankets. Police then removed those people and the blankets from the spot. The blankets have been seized in a legal manner.‚Äù
