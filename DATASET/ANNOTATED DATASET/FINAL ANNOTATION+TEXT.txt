-1	recent event yet again highlight the need for electoral reform the campaign for the delhi assembly election be fill with hate speech in madhya pradesh the rule congress be battle defection last year in november in maharashtra devendra fadnavis take oath a chief minister early morning one day only to be replace within day by uddhav thackeray from the opposition alliance which consist of party that be ideologically mismatch and before that in karnataka defection from the janata dal (secular) congress coalition to the bjp bring the government down capturing power first we need to understand why this be happen the answer be simple the primary goal of political party be to capture power and they use all the mean at their disposal to obtain power power bring money privilege and control of the treasury the total budget expenditure of the central government for 2019 20 be ₹27 86 lakh crore so the stake be high political party in power be suppose to deliver good governance and serve the public but usually power become an end in itself the fact that more and more freebie be be provide nowadays clearly show that public fund be be use by those in power to lure voter and be not necessarily be use for public service let u look at a few important way in which the power game be play out in india in delhi hate speech deliver by a few member of a political party do not help that party come to power but that be not the issue — in another state in another election this tactic may work there be two factor that strengthen the grow deterioration in the quality of campaign one be the rapidly increase criminalisation of politics in 2019 the lok sabha have 43 mps with a criminal record up from about 23 in 2004 political party that give ticket to such candidate be directly responsible for this the other factor be the widespread use of social medium to spread fake news during an election campaign most of what be online consist of abuse of rival and vilification of opposition party money also fuel much of what we see today it be money that be responsible for the defection in karnataka in 2019 and in madhya pradesh recently the practice of whisk away mlas to distant resort to prevent them from be lure away by the opposition be unique to india who be elect or which party win do not seem to matter any long in this game those with money and the ability to engineer defection can always come to power two factor contribute to this open use of money to topple government one be the total lack of transparency in the fund of political party electoral bond have make it even more difficult to trace the source of fund of political party the second be that political party in power have complete hold over law and order a corporate scamster be arrest when the money trail be discover but no effort be take to trace the money trail during massive defection good governance need democracy but today hardly any political party in india be internally democratic they be fully control by a small rule clique finances be raise and use in a completely opaque way the situation be ripe for a small group of enterprising person to raise fund and capture power and then exercise it without accountability the use of muscle and money power make re election possible parties that try to win power base on a track record of good governance show mix result consequences so we have the root cause of the problem the goal of political power without adequate transparency and accountability before we come to the remedy we need to understand the consequence of the system we have today all government whether central or state be in financial difficulty more than 25 of the central budget be spend on pay interest on money borrow by the government then there be deficit finance the central government have make effort to bring it down but have not be able to meet it target india’s fiscal deficit be among the high in the develop world with the imf estimate it to be 7 5 of the gdp in 2019 state government finance be bad a substantial amount be spend on salary and pension then we have the huge problem in the financial sector with bank non bank financial company and ilfs go almost into liquidation that mean that a lot of the public’s money be either go or be under great risk is there a link between the use of election fund and non perform asset in bank other manifestation of these problem be an increase number of government scam corruption grow fear and insecurity average or poor governance include public service provide by the government and rise unemployment how can we really expect good service for the tax we pay if 43 of mps have criminal case against them the way forward india need a system that throw up party and politician whose primary goal be public service not power mahatma gandhi suggest a way “democracy be an impossible thing until power be share by all even a labourer who make it possible for you to earn your live will have his share in self government.” that goal of have enlighten politician who feel answerable to the people be perhaps distant for now we need democratic accountable and transparent political party we need to check the use of muscle and money power politicians in the rule party be rarely if ever arrest and old case against them be even withdraw sometimes no action be take against those make hate speech only rival politician be target this show that the police follow the order of their political master therefore police reform be require as a quick fix for misuse of money power and engineer defection a forensic audit by an independent agency should be mandatory when mlas defect to other party as the famous watergate dictum go we need to “follow the money” that alone can restore public confidence in democracy above all we need political party reform that make party transparent accountable and democratic but we be in a logjam those who can reform the system do not want to voters be no doubt get educate rapidly but they be not in a position to bring about inner change in the electoral and political system merely through vote some kind of citizen action to raise awareness may be require otherwise thing will have to get bad before they get good trilochan sastry be founder and trustee of the association for democratic reforms and professor iim bangalore

-1	on 4 december 2019 sachin pilot deputy chief minister of rajasthan visit lse to speak to student while at lse he sit down with tom wilkinson lse to discus the role student can play in indian politics the recent student protest and the future of the congress party watch a livestream of sachin pilot’s q a with lse student in your spearhead of the congress victory in rajasthan in december 2018 what be the role of student and young people in your campaign i think a great amount of the change we saw in the last election come from the young generation of the vote population in rajasthan i think work through and with young mind be important because i think they have much more at stake in the future their aspiration and their role in today’s government and governance be very important university student and the entire eco system of the university the faculty etc be all think people it’s important to have them on board for any change you want to bring about whether it’s political or societal i get a lot of support from the young generation some of them be not even student but young people be more susceptible to change and be not so accept of the status quo – we want to build on that during my campaign private education in india be unaffordable for many ordinary indians and affordable university be often under resourced is there any light on the horizon for the million of indian youth want a high education there be two side of the story there be very prestigious cut edge institution that be start fifty or seventy year ago such a the iits indian institutes of technology and the iims indian institutes of management their research area have do well higher education be generally beyond the reach of most but the one that we have create those institution have invariably do well we have also try to make it inexpensive a far a the government be concern because a you know not all education be control by the government there be lot of private player who be now play a major role so it’s a situation where you want to have an abundant supply but you don’t want to compromise on quality there be stringent rule about private player invest in university and create colleges…in the last fifteen year there’s be some top notch private institution come into play largely i think it’s the government that have establish university and college in the field of medicine science research and management the government have do a fair amount and try to keep a cap on how expensive it can be it won’t be right to say that it’s completely unaffordable but the capacity be small – and we must expand that dramatically the thousand of student that have be campaign against a huge increase in accommodation fee have bring one of india’s best university at jawaharlal nehru university jnu where i spend time last year a a visit research scholar to a standstill and there have be serious student police violence what do you make of this political situation i think it’s very distress – the event that be unfold on campus and outside campus between the jnu student who be protest against the fee hike and the hostel hike one can’t make the argument that it have to be self serve and it can’t be subsidise because jnu have produce some of the best bureaucrat politician and scholar in recent time it’s an institution that have make a name for itself around the world i think the far more important part be the low income student group who go there would not get this quality of education anywhere in the world or even in india for that cost they genuinely can’t afford it one can make the argument that it last hike be do twenty or thirty year ago but the principle behind government subside education it’s not just in india but anywhere in the world be clear and jnu have leave a mark because of the quality that it have produce i don’t think that the government should really have let it go that far they really have to listen to the student who be demand nothing but a reasonable and practical way of function there be lot of clause add and hide element in the fee hike and some of these family and their kid can’t really afford it i see that india be a country that be socialist in nature there be no reason why they should impose such a hike and such a huge increase in one swift go especially when the sentiment be so against it there be no reason for the government to try to bulldoze it way through and ultimately they’ve have to row back most of it anyway they could have avoid the whole commotion thinking about the way this government be transform indian politics do you think the assault on jnu by the bjp say something quite important about the change in indian politics you can take a political mean out of what have happen because i think some of the rule party member have categorically and directly attack the student for what they stand for i don’t think it’s correct for any rule dispensation to make a student body or a university or an institution the target of it government because once you govern you should govern an entire country include student at institution that don’t comply with your ideology in a democracy you should be able to live if not happily then at least meaningfully with people whose view don’t agree with yours it’s be see a if the government be against what the student stand for and that’s never a good sign for a healthy politick in a country like ours there should not be moment of stand off against each other you’re right the impression one get be that it have be do because of the ideology that the university jnu represent because in student politics there isn’t an alignment with what the government of india think it may not be in alignment with my view but i still respect their view and their opinion if we do not accept them we must respect their view students from the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad abvp be protest and strike about the appointment of a sanskrit literature professor at another great indian university banaras hindu university bhu because he be a muslim what do you make of the role of the abvp on campus across india i be sad that this have even become an issue the fact that a person belong to a particular religion should be stop from teach sanskrit or any other subject be completely against the grain of what we stand for the fact that we be a republic with a constitution that guarantee that every citizen have equal right it’s sadden to think that this have become an issue in fact we should be embrace this man who be clearly qualify to teach those course in sanskrit when he be a muslim by religion i think it an epitome of what india be here you have a muslim bear individual whose exceedingly qualify to teach sanskrit in that university we must embrace that his religious orientation have no bear on what he be teach it’s outrageous that this have become an issue this be not the way india should be move forward you be a senior leader of the indian national congress what be the fortune of congress these day let me put it this way we have win two election in a row we have lose two election in a row politics be not just about win election it’s about strive and work for what you believe in so the congress party have obviously get much le than what it have expect but it’s not the end of the day you still must go on fight for what you believe

to the lure of freebie — power water and transport — which help it draw support from the grateful throng in slum cluster and irregular colony besides it performance in public education and health kejriwal’s image be a big advantage that get strong because of bjp’s inability to project a cm face congress’s continue marginalisation help give the overlap between aap’s supporter and what once use to be congress’s constituency the return of some erstwhile backer to congress have see aap slide to the third spot in the ls election but clearly it’s recover from that setback kejriwal run a smart campaign stay focus on his message of “development” dodge bjp’s effort to lure him into take a stand on caa and decline to join issue on other contentious issue such a his refusal to give sanction for prosecution of kanhaiya kumar and umar khalid for allegedly raise “tukde tudke” slogan at jnu faced with bjp’s highpress “nationalism” manoeuvre kejriwal swiftly improvise and cast himself a a “hanuman bhakt” and a “hardcore nationalist” it be a smart counter measure which de ideologised the battle just when shah’s campaign against the shaheen bagh protest have appear to find resonance among significant section of the majority community raise the prospect of polarisation along communal line the advantage so gain be multiply by the fact that kejriwal’s status a bjp’s sole challenger ensure him the support of the minority community in another midway switch aap’s tactician launch the new “dilli mein toh kejriwal” campaign line to frustrate bjp’s attempt to pit him against pm narendra modi instead he target local bjp leader convert the election into a duel where he appear to be “dilli ka dabang” who dwarf an assembly of saffron lightweight it be crucial because besides the message of nationalism and modi’s appeal bjp have little else go for it the state unit have be in disarray with the ego conflict among it leader defy shah’s attempt to knock them into a team after it success on all seven seat in the ls election the party fritter away crucial time in wait for the leadership to name it choice for cm thus lose the psychological advantage it could have potentially have over aap it look clueless when kejriwal seek to recover lose grind by announce freebie and launch an unprecedented publicity blitzkrieg shah take charge do help restore morale and energise the cadre to put up a fight but by then kejriwal have already sprint away the failure of the three bjp run corporation to perform only add to the lustre of kejriwal’s “acche beete 5 saal” plank congress put in no effort at all despite the fact that unlike kejriwal it have take a strident stand against caa rahul gandhi and priyanka gandhi vadra put in perfunctory campaign appearance leave a lacklustre state unit — a bench of have beens — to fend for themselves post drub some party leader insist the “no show” be tactical a it do not want anti bjp vote to split but the “sacrifice” theory could hardly mask the grow irrelevance of the party in one more geography the debacle will reinforce the perception that the much talk about organisational recovery could be a long way off and encourage non bjp regional satrap to present themselves a the main alternative to the saffron party aap’s victory be significant also in that it mark the arrival of a new crop of leader while kejriwal and his deputy manish sisodia stand tall than those array on the saffron side of the field debut win by atishi marlena raghav chadha and dilip pandey will add to aap’s bench strength in the assembly and make up for

-1	india updated jan 23 2020 07 15 ist the way a country define who it citizen can be define what the country be in the case of india 70 year ago we give ourselves a constitution which define who we be by adopt a secular and religion blind criterion for citizenship part ii of the constitution provide for citizenship by birth person himself bear in india descent either parent bear in india or domicile have be reside in india for a certain amount of time in addition all those person who have migrate to india a a result of partition and even those who have migrate to pakistan but return to india before a certain date be entitle to citizenship thus a muslim resident of india who migrate to pakistan on or about the time of partition but return to india before the constitution come into force on january 26 1950 be also entitle to claim indian citizenship these principle be accept after consider debate in the constituent assembly this plural basis of citizenship be carry into the citizenship act 1955 whose primary purpose be to determine the principle of “acquisition and termination” of citizenship to supplement the constitutional provision changes be make in the detail of the citizenship law from time to time for instance in 1986 on account of apprehension that certain person who be foreigner be give birth to their child in india solely for the purpose that the child acquire indian citizenship by birth an amendment be make that apply prospectively so that all those who be bear in india post 1987 would be eligible for indian citizenship only if one of their parent be also an indian citizen while this be a significant departure from the principle of jus solo which guarantee citizenship solely by birth it be not base on identity of the individual particularly immutable one such a religion or country of origin different wave of migrant be it the tibetans from china post 1950s or the ugandans of indian origin who be throw out during the reign of idi amin in the 1970s be grant citizenship under these religion neutral race neutral ethnicity neutral and origin neutral law in fact the law of citizenship in india be so non controversial that until the passage of citizenship amendment act 2019 or caa last month most practise lawyer be not even aware of the detail of indian citizenship law this secular model of acquisition of citizenship serve many objective the first and most important be that it give assurance to every citizen irrespective of their religious or ethnic identity that they be equal to every other citizen in the country this “de jure” equality may not always result in a “de facto” equality certain caste group or religious group have continue to enjoy more power in the society than others but the constitutional assurance that before the law everyone be equal have broadly assure every religious ethnic group in the country that institutionalise discrimination be not one of the objective of the state second the plural and secular basis of indian citizenship have allow india to evolve an international reputation of be an inclusive society india stand out not just in south asia which have large number of theocratic state with prefer state religion such a pakistan islam srilanka buddhism bangladesh lslam and bhutan buddhism but also a a potential inclusive world leader countries that discriminate among their own population do not have a history of emerge a global leader subsequent to the passage of the caa over the last one month it be clear how both these advantage have evaporate protests across the country by several section of the society have show that the people be not protest because the amendment in the citizenship act will impact them personally but because the foundation of equal citizenship a a core found value be seek to be breach by the amendment even if one look at the caa in isolation without combine it with national register of citizens nrc unsurprisingly the repeat assurance by the government that the caa do not seek to take away citizenship of any exist indian citizen have have no impact a people be not react to just the caa but have ass caa for what it really be a significant change on how the state will from hereon prioritise citizenship claim around a certain prefer religion similarly the international criticism particularly in the international press of the narendra modi government and the direction it be take india into have be scathing having survive it first term in the jet stream of india’s global secular credential modi’s india have quickly become like erdogan’s turkey in the international mind one would have hop that give the serious negative domestic and international fallout of the caa the government would have retrace it step but in it obstinacy the government have dig it heal in citizenship be describe a the “right to have rights” and an inform and politically aware citizenry such a that of india be unlikely to give up the fight it have

1	one of the thing that keep anti caa protest such a the one in shaheen bagh go be a moral legitimacy it be project a an ‘organic uprising’ by citizen especially muslims who have be deal a cruel blow by an ‘authoritarian’ government that have ‘gone against the constitution and be try to divide the country on the basis of religion’ this in a nutshell be the charge against narendra modi government regardless of caa’s reality of what it may or may not do in oppose the government and demand a repeal therefore the protestors be defend the constitution and be the moral guardian of society — or so at least go the justification and the narrative in two back to back speech in parliament on thursday the prime minister take away the moral justification behind the protest and strip the ‘movement’ of it elaborate construct to reveal the political project within coincidentally modi’s intervention in parliament on the protest come on the day enforcement directorate ed submit a report to home

cnnnews18 february 6 2020 the ed will have to prove it case and we haven’t hear the last of that development but the prime minister’s twin speech in lok sabha and rajya sabha dig into history and establish a clear link between india’s political discourse and policy position on non muslim refugee since partition and the amendment pas by the modi government in january 2020 this link be important because it bust the narrative that have so far feed and justify the continue picket in the heart of new delhi the demonstration whose islamist underpinnings and political motif be slowly unfold before our eye be base on the narrative that modi government have deviate from india’s secular tradition in bring a law that give citizenship to non muslim refugee from neighbour nation though the caa in no way alter the legal status of any indian citizen this spurious narrative allow the organiser and vest interest to use ‘secularism’ ‘defence of the constitution’ ‘flag waving’, ‘preamble reading’ and ‘anthem singing’ a cover to play their political game and meet partisan objective the moral justification behind “defence of the constitution and indian secular tradition” also allow extremist element within the community such a sharjeel imam to use the platform a a legitimate tool and advance their dream of break india by dig into history and read out extract from a resolution pas by a congress working committee in 1947 to quote extensively from jawaharlal nehru lal bahadur shastri ram manohar lohia br ambedkar and even jogendra nath mandal and bhupendra kumar dutt modi launch a staunch defence of caa during his parliament speech and show that the amendment be the logical culmination of a policy of give shelter to persecute minority from india’s neighbourhood that have long be part of india’s political discourse the position take by india’s former prime minister political stalwart found father of constitution and even lawmaker in pakistan show that not only have caa correct a historic blunder it be not anti muslim legislation and be root firmly in india’s secular tradition this be a surgical strike carry out on the spurious narrative against caa by the prime minister and he use congress’ own luminary to execute it modi’s first point of reference during his reply to the motion of thanks on president’s address in lok sabha be nehru he refer to the nehru liaquat pact sign in 1950 to point out that it be mean to protect “minorities” in pakistan and pose “why do nehru a big thinker and a secularist say ‘minorities’ and not ‘all citizens’ of pakistan ” he then quote from nehru’s letter write in 1950 to gopinath bordoloi assam’s first chief minister where india’s first prime minister ask the assam government to differentiate between “hindu refugee and muslim immigrants” in parliament in 1950 nehru have say that “there be no doubt that the affect people who have come to settle in india deserve citizenship and if the law isn’t suitable then it should be modified…” “was pandit nehru communal did he want to create a hindu rashtra did he discriminate between hindus and muslims ” modi ask of the opposition bench point out that his government have do what nehru have say decade ago he then refer to freedom fighter bhupendra kumar datta a member of all india congress committee who stay in pakistan after partition but eventually return to india protest against “abject persecution of minority in that country” modi quote datta a say in the constituent assembly “so far a the side of pakistan concern minority be practically liquidate those who live in east pakistan live in total frustration” modi also quote from the resignation letter of congressman jogendra nath mandal the first law minister in pakistan who also return to india after raise his voice against the treatment of minority in pakistan and east pakistan now bangladesh in the resignation letter to liaquat ali khan mandal write “i must say that this policy of drive out hindus from pakistan have succeed completely in west pakistan and be near completion in east pakistan too… pakistan have not give the hindus entire satisfaction and a full sense of security they now want to get rid of the hindu intelligentsia so that the political economic and social life of pakistan may not in any way be influence by them ” in his rajya sabha speech modi’s first reference be former prime minister shastri whose word on a resolution in parliament on 3 april 1964 be “the house be of the opinion that in view of the insecurity of the life property and honour of the minority community live in the eastern wing of pakistan and general denial of all human right to them in part of pakistan the government of india should in addition to relax restriction in migration of people belong to minority community from east pakistan to indian union also consider step for enlist the world opinion ” modi then quote lohia urge “samajwadi friends” to listen to their ideologue and founder “i refuse the fact that we should not care about the hindus of pakistan since they be pakistani citizen irrespective of citizenship of pakistan’s hindus it be our duty to protect them like we protect indian muslims and hindus…” add this wasn’t say by a bjp or a jan sangh leader but ram manohar lohia i urge samajwadis to not ignore him” on the anti caa resolution be pas by different state modi quote shastri again point out that many state in 1964 when most be under congress rule have volunteer to resettle non muslim refugee and also quote from a rajya sabha speech deliver by the former prime minister where he say that “as far a east pakistan be concern it decision seem to indicate that all non muslims will be drive out from there it be an islamic state… non muslims cannot live there…” modi then ask “will you also call him communal ” finally modi refer to the resolution pas by the cwc on 25 november 1947 where it read “congress be further bind to afford full protection to all those non muslims from pakistan who have cross the border and come to india or may do so to save their life and honour ” this set the stage for a part shoot from modi “i don’t think congress be communal in 1947 and have turn secular suddenly you could have write all community come from pakistan why do you use the term ‘non muslims’?” on npr that have be link to caa and have be oppose by various state opposition leader and the ecosystem critical of the government modi point out that npr be implement in 2010 and biometric data be collect in 2011 — when congress lead upa be in power “by 2014 when you be out of power the photo data of crore of people be collect the work of npr be on npr record which you have prepare be update in 2015 your record be use to reach out to beneficiary leave out of welfare scheme like pradhan mantri awas yojana and direct benefit transfer… today you be oppose and stop people from take benefit of such scheme ” the prime minister’s meticulous research into history be an attempt to show primarily that it be the congress and opposition that have deviate from india’s secular tradition and have go back on their promise and word but the speech also elaborate how the current protest be not a result of policy dissonance but a de facto political project against the electoral hegemony of modi lead bjp government and expression of frustration against

problem of a nosedive national economy and the utterly confound manner in which the union government be deal with it ghastly campaign in this context the singular effort of the bjp in the delhi assembly election especially in the last phase of the campaign be to take this hindutva project forward aggressively and methodically by vitiate the communal situation in the national capital region by depict the electoral battle a one between hindus and muslims this ghastly campaign which be lead by union home minister and former bjp president amit shah and send a large number of union ministers and over 200 members of parliament into almost every street and mohalla of delhi even go to the extent of portray the election a one where the choice for the people be between india and pakistan central to this campaign be the vitriolic outpouring against anti caa protester especially the woman and child at shaheen bagh in the okhla area of the capital who have launch an indefinite sit in in early december that attract widespread attention and support from across the country include from renowned intellectual and artist several leader of the bjp include union minister anurag thakur exhort audience during the course of the campaign to shoot the anti caa protester party mp parvesh verma warn that if the aap win the election it would create a situation where hindu woman would get rap by those who have gather at shaheen bagh drawing parallel with what he argue have happen elsewhere he state “we all know what jehad be jehad be to convert all non muslims to muslims this be what they do in kashmir wherever slogan of jehad will be raise the outcome will be the same what happen in kashmir can happen in delhi too ” his one point solution to prevent this be to defeat the aap and vote the bjp to power as the campaign draw to a close the grow sentiment within the bjp leadership be that the divisive campaign have strike a chord in the delhi electorate a series of meet amit shah have with diverse segment of the party a well a the sangh parivar two day before poll revolve around this single point the traction and the acceleration that the party’s communal polarisation manoeuvre be gain at the grass root close to the poll date amit shah reportedly have make detail presentation at every one of these meet with projection about population and vote percentage these presentation delineate an electoral scene where the bjp be fast catch up and even overtake the aap primarily on the combine strength of two factor the demography of delhi comprise a whop 81.68 per cent hindus and the virulent muscular nationalism campaign mark by the “gaddaron ko goli maro” shoot the traitor slogan and the communal target of the anti caa protest of which the shaheen bagh sit in have become a symbol the vehemence generate by the campaign be such that it trigger actual shoot incident against protester by hindutva desperado and this development be ass at these meet a add value to the bjp’s election prospect the image of prime minister modi take aim with an automatic gun at the defence expo in lucknow have precede these meet and this too be evaluate a send out an appropriately aggressive but subtle message to the delhi electorate in short the assessment be that the time be ripe to go for the “electoral” kill the figure present by amit shah supplement this understand according to these figure the delhi electorate have different yardstick for lok sabha and assembly election and hence there be no question of the bjp replicate the lok sabha vote percentage of 56.58 per cent the estimation in the figure present at the meet be that the bjp start with a core vote base of approximately 32 per cent in the assembly election this be the vote share the party have in the 2015 assembly election too however it be point out that the aggressive hindutva orient propaganda in the last week of the campaign have add about seven to eight percentage point amit shah’s exhortation at these meet to worker and leader belong to different echelon of the party and the sangh parivar be to add another five percentage point on the date of poll through booth management the contention be that this would be good enough to upstage the aap whose vote share amit shah have peg at 40 to 42 per cent a three percentage point advantage in vote share he have apparently argue would reflect in a substantive seat difference in the first past the post electoral system this understand manifest in very many way after the poll interacting informally with d raja general secretary of the communist party of india in the central hall of parliament barely 20 hour before the count of vote be to begin on february 11 meenakshi lekhi bjp lok sabha member from the new delhi parliamentary constituency assert that the aap’s victory project by the exit poll be a pipe dream and that the bjp be set to form the government with at least 43 seat manoj tiwari the bjp’s delhi unit president go one step further and state a couple of hour before the count be to begin that he would not be surprise even if the bjp win 55 seat but all these calculation go for a toss when the final outcome come the bjp end up with a 38.52 per cent vote share an increase of approximately six percentage point from it estimate 32 per cent core vote the aap on it part garner 53.61 per cent of the vote signify a marginal drop from it 2015 share of 54.3 per cent clearly a huge majority of hindus have prefer the aap which be seek to be paint a pro pakistan and anti hindu by the bjp and it associate in the sangh parivar the slogan that ring out at the aap headquarter after the victory repeatedly underscore this aspect of the election result hundreds of aap supporter assert that secularism be at the core of the party and that it volunteer have successfully defeat vile attempt to divide the people on communal line and every one of them could be hear argue that it be the “development agenda of kejriwal” that have help the party achieve this the unanimous popular view on this development agenda be that apart from the well know and tangible initiative such a reduce electricity charge provide free water to vast segment of the population enhance school infrastructure and improve public health system the significant reduction in corruption at the level of the state administration too be a factor that impel the electorate to resolutely stave off the communal and divisive politics of the bjp throughout the campaign aap leader and volunteer consistently highlight the detail of the “politics of development” reach out to almost every household with detail of the government initiative talking to frontline senior aap leader sanjay singh highlight some of the feature of the campaign material which include detail such a the comparison between state and central economic parameter it state that the annual average gross domestic state product of delhi be 8.92 per cent over the period between 2015 16 and 2018 19, while during the same four year period india’s average annual gross domestic product growth rate be 7.35 per cent delhi’s per caput income at rs 2 79 601 in 2018 19 be high than the national average of rs 91 921 for the same period the fiscal deficit of delhi be at 0.40 per cent considerably low than the overall national rate for states which stand at 2.59 per cent budgetary allocation in area such a education health transport and water supply have consistently be high throughout the aap tenure and in the 2019 20 budget measure up to approximately 56 per cent of the total allocation of this education a a percentage of total expenditure be at 27.8 per cent in 2019 20. in comparison the national average for 27 states be far behind at 15.9 per cent the budgetary allocation for major subsidy such a the delhi transport corporation’s concessional pas and below poverty line water consumer be also highlight in the campaign sanjay singh point out that when kejriwal say after the result that the politics of delhi and the country have change he mean this new attention to detail that have become part of the political campaign a well a the electorate’s inform understand of the same aap’s silence on vital issue notwithstanding such positive the deafen silence of the aap especially kejriwal on a number of vital issue have come in for question by political leader and social activist the most conspicuous one be on the caa and the attack on jawaharlal nehru university and jamia millia islamia even after jnu student be attack kejriwal do not visit the university or the hospital where the injure be admit it be also point out that the party side with many controversial decision take by the bjp government at the centre include the abrogation of article 370 the party also keep quiet on the supreme court’s ayodhya verdict for the construction of a ram temple these have lead to criticism that the aap be essentially play centre right politics and hence the delhi result do not signify a win for the value of secularism or communal harmony on their part the aap leadership argue that respond to these question would have be tantamount to fall into the trap of the bjp a it would have accentuate the communal narrative in the campaign “what we make possible be a great almost impossible realpolitik manoeuvre and everybody should see the net result the so call chanakya of indian politics have be humble by a party that be only a few year old in the long run this result will change the way politics be play out in this country ” a close associate of kejriwal tell frontline responses from other opposition party such a the congress the samajwadi party the telugu desam party and the trinamool congress have focus on the importance of the defeat of the bjp and the aap’s development record at the large level the delhi defeat mark yet another in the series of electoral reverse suffer by the bjp in state assembly election starting with rajasthan madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh before the lok sabha election in may 2019 and follow by haryana maharashtra and jharkhand election the bjp have face reverse despite all these be hindu majority states the big question be whether the bjp and the large sangh parivar will understand that majoritarian hindutva polarisation by unleash the divisive politics of hatred islamophobia and muscular nationalism will not be a permanent win ploy as for the aap it also face the big question of whether it will be ultimately define a a postmodern political phenomenon that be completely bereft of ideological orientation a well a commitment to the value enshrine in the constitution despite the substantive value it bring especially in electoral term to the fight against authoritarian tendency and in bolster secularism even a these large question beg for an answer the short  and medium term importance of the aap victory in delhi remain more than anything else it have prove once again that in regional electoral battle if there be a credible political organisation with a well oil party machinery found on a sense of realism people will be ready to vote against the bjp in 2015 when the bjp lose in delhi many political observer saw the aap’s victory a a political fluke impel by enthusiastic and idealistic youngster but in 2020 with the bjp have already suffer reverse in october 2019 in jharkhand haryana and maharashtra the mighty blow in delhi can well be see a the late sign of an emerge trend

illustration by c r sasikumar a politician not hungry for power be almost a hard to imagine a a tiger that abjure meat his natural diet be power particularly over the grand narrative of history an academic on the other hand be a herbivore whose predilection be for interpretative ambiguity an abide tendency to ferret out the flaw in receive historical text the metaphoric division among these group be demonstrable there’s a marx for every marat and a gandhi for each gibbon history arrange too for occasional disturb confrontation in a broadly weberian sense between these putative “types” of social agent in the student protest that have occur across the country over the past month we have witness clash that could partially be describe in term of weber’s notion of “disenchantment” true political party have quickly jump on the bandwagon and align themselves with or against the movement yet among university student the slow burn of a smoulder resentment have be apparent for some year this be bind to flare up sooner or late from focus anger against caste and religious discrimination and severe fee hike to a generalise discontent about mediocre teach and a lack of prospect after graduation student have felt disenfranchise in certain situation they have commit suicide surely the ultimate act of protest only last semester one of my best student in the engineer science tell me that he do not want a job nor do he want to do research he just want to “do nothing” small everyday anecdote like this raise big trouble question about a story that have captivate u of late this be the joyous narrative of the “demographic dividend” wherein an overwhelmingly young aspirational india on the move will beat all odds the irony be that it be exactly this population that be now show sign of acute distress manifest in their widespread opposition to the citizenship amendment act caa and the national register of citizens nrc opinion with a flag song and book reclaiming national symbol be an act of political genius and imagination several analyst have however raise the question why these particular inflexion point what be it about the caa and nrc that have so mobilise our youth it be here the idea of “disenchantment” could help u — and we will certainly need such framework of analysis a these “leaderless” movement develop the argument follow weber would go a bite like this as individual bear into modernity we be not disenchant just because something awful happen to u personally such a a series of tragedy in the family in a society like india we might rely on the traditional consolation of karma or kismet to explain these terrible happen the personal be decidedly not the political here disenchantment on the other hand take hold when large share ideal such a those foster by contemporary nation state appear to fail citizen or when there be severe clash of ideology about how to arrive at a cooperative goal such a universal employment or healthcare political ideal immensely big than personal dilemma tend in short to trigger affective “disenchantment” both the caa and nrc turn on the central concept of “the citizen” which be precisely the sort of capacious domain that can inspire idea of national unity a well a widespread disenchantment this be because they raise for the youth of this country and for all of u a difficult question that may have go unasked in their lifetime namely what make someone a citizen and can some citizen be le equal than others in the eye of the state so fundamental be this query about the constitution of our society that we cannot shy away from a vigorous debate on the subject and we must remain stubbornly commit to protect the right of our student to gather peacefully and speak out forcefully we have also to reeducate ourselves almost 75 year after independence about the mean of word we have since often carelessly take for grant — keywords such a freedom democracy and equality this dialogic “citizens route” be our only fairly narrow path towards “re enchantment” or the magical triumph of hope over hatred weber maintain that people can be so charm by the ideal that “charismatic” leader place before them that they be ready to put their material well be and even their live at risk for these idealist cause india of course have have no dearth of such charismatic personality both in it “religious” past and it “secular” present however it be when such leader be see a non perform or manipulative that the process of disenchantment set in weber a thinker whose lifespan run roughly parallel to gandhi’s be himself pretty disenchant by the post world war i scenario he regard the bureaucracy of his time a an “iron cage” discern “dirt muck dung and horseplay” everywhere castigate politician a “windbags” and opine that leftist like rosa luxemburg belong in “the zoological gardens” do we not hear echo in these choice phrase about our own current discontent to return here to the theme of student unrest with which i begin we know the word “student” be pair with the word “teacher” in an inextricable semantic conjunction like “parent child” or “husband wife”, not to mention the hegelian “master slave” duality an understand of one part of these expression imply knowledge of the mean of it “other” it be this long stand relationship that have be destabilise today as a teacher over the past 30 year the naïve think that i want to end with concern the reversal of the basic “teacher student” pair in an environment where mesmerise new enchantment that weber never anticipate have enter our world opinion students be protest because of our education not despite it if thomas carlyle write in the 19th century at a time when the diversification of knowledge via the technological invention of the print press be well underway that the “true university” of his day be “a collection of books” perhaps the true university of our time be the internet an immediate reconsideration of the teacher student, guru shishya, compact be prompt by this simple comparison today our cellphone be not only our most intimate companion but de facto the most go to source of knowledge they be our most creative teacher — or be they certainly we have to concede that our student be much more at home in and ready to engage with this beguile virtual world than we be online witness to method of

power of robot avatar and social medium to guide our emotion and of tech company and government to covertly watch not to say control our action now require u to radically update weber’s crucial insight concern enchantment and social action a revise partnership agreement between teacher and student be therefore urgently call for a we enter this unknown nth space of citizenship there’s no doubt in my mind that it be in this cyber world of augment reality that vital battle over possible disenchantment will be fight in the future in the present though we be leave with weber’s implicit

1	new delhi prime minister narendra modi today february 6 tactically harness jawaharlal nehru – a man he have lose no love for – to hit back at the congress and it opposition to the citizenship amendment act caa modi refer to a letter nehru purportedly write to assam’s first chief minister gopinath bordoloi in 1949 ask him to “absorb” refugee from east pakistan on the argument that he would have to “differentiate” between hindu refugee and muslim migrant “was nehru communal ” ask modi in typical style but this clever reference to nehru’s letter to take on congress for oppose the caa be a sharp u turn from where he and the bharatiya janata party have recurrently posit bordoloi vi à vi nehru the letter that modi refer to be most probably the one bring to the public domain in 2006 by then bjp president of assam siddhartha bhattacharjee as per a report in the telegraph then bhattacharjee claim to have find the letter “among document belong to his father late gauri shankar bhattacharjee ” a left leader of significant stature in the state gauri shankar bhattacharjee be consider a have be close to bordoloi the news report have say that nehru’s “alleged sympathy towards the refugee shin through in his letter…” he write “therefore we have to absorb them and make provision for them so that they might be good citizen in do this all province have to help and co operate and it will do no good to a province to refuse co operation in national work ” referring to a cabinet colleague of bordoloi who be firmly oppose to the idea of take in migrant nehru add and the newspaper quote “i think he be wrong in this ” speaking to reporter then bhattacharjee now a powerful cabinet minister in the sarbananda sonowal government have say “the letter be a reflection of the pro migrant stand of the congress since the day of nehru ” that statement by the bjp chief be air to put congress in the dock in a state where the issue of undocumented migration have captivate socio political life since independence the congress have rule the state for most since freedom modi himself have attempt to give assamese people the idea that he believe that bordoloi have be short change by the congress addressing a rally in guwahati in february 2014 in the run up to the parliamentary election modi – then the bjp’s prime ministerial candidate – invoke bordoloi to present to voter an example that the congress party allegedly never care for the state as per modi’s eponymous website he have say “so immerse be the congress in the worship of one family that they forget the contribution of others in the freedom struggle” in do so modi be only follow his party’s line in regard to bordoloi it be the atal bihari vajpayee government that confer on bordoloi a congress leader the barat ratna posthumously in 1990 it be not difficult to find opinion in assam that bordoloi be leave out of that honour by the central government under congress for take on nehru while bordoloi’s contemporary – b c roy – be bestow the high civilian award way back in 1961 also read decades of discord assam against itself placing nehru a the villain of assam and it problem by often invoke the letter to bordoloi the bjp have also long maintain that it be him – and him alone – who ‘left’ assam and what be arunachal pradesh today to the chinese during the 1962 aggression it be not difficult to find bjp leader – be it sarbananda sonowal from assam or kiren rijiju from arunachal – to refer to a line carefully pluck out of a long speech of nehru – “my heart go out to the people of assam” – to emphasise that nehru have sacrifice assam then however on february 6 while speak at parliament modi try use the uneasy nehru bordoloi relation – document through multiple letter they write to each other and repeatedly use by bjp to attack congress – to support nehru’s pro refugee stand on assam importantly he do it to lend credence to an act that assam have be vociferously oppose in spite of his party pick vote 2014 onwards in the brahmaputra valley with the promise of protect the region’s ‘jati mati bheti’ in order word on an anti migrant stand the massive opposition to the caa in the border state be – by the way – in line with bordoloi’s guard stand on refugee or migrant settlement a close read of his letter with nehru and his cabinet colleague sardar vallabhbhai patel make it clear that bordoloi be against haphazard settlement of refugee and migrant from east pakistan he cite british colonial history of settle migrant from east bengal in assam lead to conflict on the grind over issue of protect the right of the local community also read the world be already recognising refugees from the ‘hindu rashtra’ many bengali hindus in assam however point out that bordoloi’s statement in the state assembly soon after independence – “assam be for assamese” – be non inclusive of a set of people who migrate to british assam after a large swathe of sylhet go to east pakistan during partition by invoke nehru’s word to bordoloi in the lok sabha modi have however emphasise that be it the then central government or now with his government bring in an act oppose by the people of assam the centre’s stand on migration from east pakistan or bangladesh have remain unchanged and that it may be force upon people if the centre so wish apart from letter with nehru bordoloi also have epistolary run in with patel whom modi celebrate unlike nehru in a letter to him on june 22 1950 bordoloi say that his government have already shoulder the responsibility of rehabilitate one lakh new refugee in addition to the 1.25 lakh who come one and a half year ago and some 10 000 of the early batch be already allot land in the state however pressure from nehru and patel have continue on bordoloi on the issue in a letter to bordoloi on july 3 1950 patel say “priority should be give against local sentiment ” modi’s mention of nehru curiously do not invoke patel’s letter to bordoloi indeed nehru be not alone in pressurise assam to allow for the settlement of refugee in the state after partition

already in power to retain them only the biju janata dal in odisha the trinamool congress tmc in west bengal and the telangana rashtra samiti and all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam in states where the bjp be weak have manage to retain power and even these party bar the tmc have shy away from take a strong oppositional position to the bjp poll strategy the aam aadmi party aap which have be a bugbear of the bjp not only retain power win 62 of the 70 seat in the delhi assembly election but also manage to nearly emulate it strong performance in 2015 when it win 67 seat this be a credit not only to it governance record but also it ability to turn the election into a referendum on it tenure the bjp’s strong point in recent election have be to set the terrain of political discourse in the run up to the poll and force it opponent to contest on those ground aiding this strategy have be the bjp’s machine that provide it an organisational superiority which be buttress by financial power unmatched by other party the run up to the delhi election feature a no hold bar campaign by the bjp that seek to foreground the cultural jingoist narrative of the citizenship amendment act caa the dilution of article 370 and the demonisation of the protest against the caa and the national register of citizens embody in the shaheen bagh sit in. the campaign strategy be base on a calculus that have work before the bjp have only in may 2019 manage to win 56 6 of the vote in delhi harp on the government’s decisive action follow the pulwama terror attack in recent assembly election the deft use of backward class politics have be combine with the virulent use of the “hindutva” card and this have more often than not work in the bjp’s favour aap on the other hand have try to position itself a a party that be evasive or malleable with respect to ideology delhi chief minister and aap founder arvind kejriwal have indeed articulate the importance of take on the politics of hatred and communal differentiation but his party’s emphasis have largely be on his government’s record on deliver basic service to an urban electorate without recourse to identitarian bias while do so aap do not seek to actively engage with the bjp’s focal issue such a the caa nrc and the nature of the protest against this amendment meanwhile the desperate and reactive attempt by the bjp to resort to calumny against aap’s leadership only backfire in try to set the discourse during the election to be base on it governance record aap provide the delhi voter a clear choice — would they endorse the step take by the regime or would they judge it in term set by the bjp and it communal discourse this be a pivotal achievement by the aap and set the party’s victory a one achieve in much more difficult circumstance compare to it triumph in 2015 or it strong foray into electoral politics in 2013 graduate from a civil society lead movement against corruption party trump card in 2015 aap have manage to sway the delhi electorate and build a multi class coalitional support base — of the urban poor and the middle class with it promise of deliver on a corruption and patronage free governance that would reduce cost of basic service such a water supply and electricity in 2020 it manage to retain the support of this coalition through actual delivery by devote a significant portion of it

country at it narrow the strip be just 17 kilometre wide and remain one of india’s big strategic vulnerability as we ponder on the veracity of the charge and interpret the law on sedition it be worth remember that from the platform of a site shaheen bagh which be ostensibly protest against the division of india along religious line imam be ironically urge muslims to balkanise india he late deny the statement claim that he be merely call for a chakka jam regardless of imam’s claim let’s take a look at his word in the video under discussion in the clip upload by several bjp leader include arunachal chief minister pema khandu imam be hear make comment aim at disturb india’s communal harmony threaten it territorial integrity and undermine the sovereignty of indian state firstpost have not independently verify the authenticity of the video दोस्तों शाहीन बाग़ की असलियत देखें १ असम को इंडिया से काट कर अलग करना हमारी ज़िम्मेदारी २ ”chicken neck” मुसलमानो का है ३ इतना मवाद डालो पटरी पे की इंडिया की फ़ौज assam जा ना सके ४ सारे ग़ैर मुसलमानो को मुसलमानों के शर्त पर ही आना होगा if this be not anti national then what be pic twitter com kgxl3glwx1 — sambit patra sambitswaraj january 25 2020 according to a translation of the comment publish by india today imam be ostensibly tell the crowd that “ if we can organise five lakh people we will be able to permanently cut off assam from india if not permanently then at least for a month or two create ruckus on railway track and road so that it take them the government at least a month to clear thing on the grind it be our responsibility to isolate assam they government will hear u only if we cut off assam and india ” he be further hear say “the plight of muslims in assam be know to all of u caa and nrc have be implement there people be already be send to detention centre there be a bloodbath go on there in six eight month you may find out that all bengalis hindus and muslims have be kill “so if we want to help assam then we will have to block the way for the army to reach assam and also stop the supply we can do this the chicken neck corridor that connect the north east with the rest of india be inhabit primarily by muslims excerpt these word be offensive at multiple level they seek to organise member of a community give a call for action and target a strategic vulnerability to cut off a part of india imam be also spread fake news the nrc implement in assam be order by the supreme court of india and there be certainly no “bloodbath” go on he be also indulge in fear monger by falsely claim that bengalis could be kill moreover these very specific threat be not out of context remark by an immature student imam by all account be not a minor if we look at his social medium post and article contribute to digital platform the islamist nature of the individual clearly come through this be an individual who eulogise mohammad ali jinnah the architect of partition and creator of pakistan and seek to airbrush the crime of a man who among other thing create mayhem in india through his call for direct action in 1946 that cause a chain of violence across many part in india in a particularly relevant post on facebook create on 8 january 2018 imam write “ jinnah who be an indian muslim for the first 71 of the 72 year of his life be infinitely more relevant for the besiege indian muslim minority than for pakistani muslims in very specific way a an indian muslim politician fight for minority right his method his argument his success and his failure be lesson for u ” therefore while legal eagle such a markandey katju split hair to claim that imam do not commit a crime and firs against him must be quash it be worth remember that imam be not issue a lecture during an academic discussion the jinnah fanboy be seek to capitalise on and even incite anger among member of a community at a sensitive spot and moment in history by a combination of victimhood narrative and fake news and have a very clear idea on how to translate the threat into action worth remember that article 19 2 of the indian constitution allow the state to make law that restrict freedom of speech so long a

the removal or amendment of the psa “the act’s sweep power ” we say “make it open to misuse” the main problem with the psa we find be under chapter iv power to make order detain certain person section 8 detention of certain person this section provide a vast number of reason for detention range from “promoting propagate or attempt to create feel of enmity or hatred or disharmony on ground of religion race caste community or region” to incitement instigation abetment and actual commission of such act and leave it to district collector or district magistrate to decide give a 12 day period within which an advisory board have to approve the detention pointing out that the psa do not distinguish between minor and major offence allow detention for up to one year for disturbance of public order and two year for action “prejudicial to the security of the state” we have argue that “the detention period should range from one week for minor offence to one month for major offence but no long assuming that action ‘prejudicial to the security of the state’ constitute far grave offence three months’ detention should be ample for proceed to trial juveniles should not be hold under the psa at all ” the jammu and kashmir reorganisation act pas by parliament last year nullify over 150 state acts but keep the psa which be more draconian than the all india detention legislation even the

consult by our politician or be that to come too express editorial grounds for slap psa on omar mehbooba only underline how scandalous their continue detention be there be a stark contrast between the

liberal and radical clarify that they be happy the bjp have lose but not happy that the aam aadmi have win for the aap be they say a soft hindutva party hindutva politics be the politicisation of a majority community create around symbol unite with an anti minority agenda and nurture around perceive fear and insecurity what have the aap or it most visible and central icon arvind kejriwal do to fit this bill between 2014 and 2019 the aap have do the usual thing secular and progressive politician be expect to do visit to dadri for akhlaq and hyderabad for rohith vemula invite to ghulam ali to sing in delhi when he be not allow to conduct a concert in mumbai opposition to the modi government against bigoted step support to kanhaiya and najeeb and so on this so call anarchist activist of a politician have not be report to have pit any community against any other or come up with any that could support the politics of polarisation opinion arvind kejriwal run a modi like campaign to win delhi then there be these notion repeat ad nauseum but be a a matter of fact baseless kejriwal use to work with the rss when the person who he use to work with be mother theresa the aap be an anti reservation, anti dalit group be another idea manufacture in the social medium again factually wrong kejriwal have categorically say he support caste base reservation delhi school teach the constitution and ambedkar a a response to the hindutvaisation of curriculum by the bjp the most valid reason to call the aap soft hindutva be aap’s silence on caa and nrc as for fact it do in the rajyasabha out on the street and in tv room the aap mla from deputy chief minister manish sisodia and shaheen bagh mla amanatullah khan be initially with the protester and go off the scene late a it go on to be frame a a movement without political affiliation atishi and raghav chadha be on national tv oppose the bjp government on caa and nrc arvind kejriwal also criticise the bill a anti poor, unnecessary unfair and absolutely impractical in it arbitrariness had kejriwal not support sisodia or amanatullah khan he would have either distance himself from them or not give them seat in the election but neither of this happen clearly message on where the aap and kejriwal be the low class low caste muslim women’s movement for actualise the promise of constitution of india be far big than any party or any leader after all then why wasn’t the delhi election fight on the caa and nrc well it actually be but the issue be introduce into the election by the bjp a the central part of their campaign the bjp want to fight the election on national subject and the aap want to fight it on local issue had kejriwal the central aap figure go to shaheen bagh it would have also end up fight the delhi assembly election exclusively on a national issue abandon the local frame – a sure route for kejriwal to make a waterloo out of this election opinion mr kejriwal delhi be do and dust shouldn’t you visit shaheen bagh now why doesn’t kejriwal ever attack hindutwa head on, in their own term it depend on our way of be anti majoritarian. if anti majoritarianism be an exercise in give perfect sound bite rebuttal kejriwal be woefully unappealing but fascism or majoritarianism be people’s consensual crowd around a single saviour when they feel scar and helpless theoreticians have point out how it be not people be cheat into support a fascist but how they want one at a particular point in history giving people a sense of participation and belongingness against a politics in which they feel not participatory citizen of a republic but the hypnotise disconnect spectator of a huge spectacle of power be itself an anti fascist project so the aap do have an efficient anti majoritarian strategy social development action a necessary supplement to social justice rhetoric abandon the agenda of majoritarianism while soft hindutva follow it way behind slowly but surely – corrupt and tokenist one disappoint and unacceptable step from arvind kejriwal be the immediate tweet support the abrogation of article 370 where he hop the abrogation “will bring peace and development in the state” after which he have not say anything on the matter the problem be not the abrogation itself for a this article which have cease to be anything more than an emotional and symbolic issue for decade now much can be say on both side but there could be nothing to be ambiguous in the dictatorial and clandestine way in which the abrogation be impose on a people as a person who introduce participatory democracy in popular indian politics it be only grammatical for kejriwal to oppose the manner similarly a champion of federalism himself the relegation of a state to a union territory couldn’t have be acceptable to kejriwal this be one place where he act like a person scar of his constituency and show one dangerous side of his variety of populism — with a shift towards the right mass effective leader will find it difficult to take certain kind of position this be where systematisation of political value matter as for kejriwal go to the mandir and sing hanuman chalisa when ask if he know the chalisa cannot be equate with a political procession chant even “ram ram” a routine salutation of north indian hindus leave alone “jai sri ram”– a hindutva modification on it what kejriwal do be a public performance of the personal without socialise it a a mantra for his party or people it be a change for kejriwal also he be champion the nehruvian scientific legacy in his first term and now his hanuman seem to rhyme with gandhi’s rama as this be not an argument about liberalism but about secularism both model should work in short the problem be not that the aap be not anti majoritarian or anti bjp enough but it be not oppose the bjp precisely in the way liberal and radical want them to it be important to take cognizance of this aspect l the purist narrative cynical in their dogma will end up cause the loss of ally in a collective anti majoritarian struggle why do the aap look like the party that be not help by it history work the social base of urban poor youth and woman and five years’ progressive governance when it come to be call soft hindutva? why be they see a culprit unless prove innocent the aap be the political formation of a new social class neither they themselves nor the commentator be clear about what trajectory the party will take in the future precisely because the very social category it basis be still get form the pendulum be still oscillate in the class war between the new urban middle class with political hinduism a the ideological cement and the urban poor with upper middle caste volunteer leadership and pragmatic constitutional nationalism a it bind force the liberal radical commentator who largely belong to the feudal family and have a certain progressive leave vocabulary suddenly might be find themselves in a vacuum  neither social experience nor vocabulary offer any solace of familiarity it must understandably be scary and alienate to deal in political narrative that look like such an unknown territory of rank outsider one way to handle such incomprehensibility be to narrate it in available term translate the whole social phenomenon to know box and thus exhaust it possibility in prediction  an

downsize the state of jammu kashmir into a union territory the opposition congress suggest this be a double standard when you seek full statehood for delhi i don’t think so we think this be in the country’s interest and take a decision to support it do you see the congress a a contender in the current election the survey come in suggest that the congress be settle for two three per cent of the vote share in the 2015 assembly poll the congress get 9 8 of the popular vote you have complete against pretty formidable odds a full term in office how do you feel about it there’s no doubt that

-1	joining the dots be a weekly column by author and journalist samrat in which he connect event to idea often through analysis but occasionally through satire the result for the delhi poll show that the aam aadmi party lead by chief minister arvind kejriwal have manage to hold on to power quite comfortably it stave off a determine and well funded, well organise challenge from the bhartiya janata party which saw rally by top leader include prime minister narendra modi and home minister amit shah the bjp campaign have focus on typically divisive politics its hoard highlight it achievement so far — the removal of article 370 the removal of the triple talaq law and the passage of the citizenship amendment act caa all of which be polarise national issue among local issue it highlight the anti caa protest at shaheen bagh the tone of that highlight be clear from a campaign speech of union minister of state for finance anurag thakur who raise the now famous “goli maaro salo ko” slogan other prominent campaigner include uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath who in his speech accuse kejriwal of feed the protestors at shaheen bagh biryani — something that in his view of the world be undoubtedly a serious crime the aam aadmi party by contrast highlight the achievement of it last five year in office its slogan be “acche beete paanch saal lage raho kejriwal” mean “five year pas well keep at it kejriwal” it point to it work in improve the state’s government school and clinic and reduction in water and electricity bill perhaps more important than what it do be what it do not do it do not engage the bjp in any ideological battle kejriwal keep a safe distance from shaheen bagh he be miss and silent even when young boy and girl in jawaharlal nehru university jnu be be assault by goon before the eye of the national medium instead he go and sing a rather tuneless rendition of the hanuman chalisa in a tv interview and follow it up with a visit to the hanuman temple in connaught place “prayed for the progress of country and delhi ” he tweet afterwards in hindi “the lord say you be do good work keep serve people like this leave the result to me all will be well” it would appear that kejriwal hear hanuman ji right part of the reason for aap’s win can be trace to kejriwal’s display of devotion and his position on “nationalistic” issue where he avoid conflict with the bjp he have his reason a significant part of those who vote aap in the assembly poll — perhaps a high a one quarter of the total infer from change in vote share from assembly to lok sabha poll — be people who vote for bjp at the national level they seem to prefer kejriwal a delhi chief minister and narendra modi a prime minister their switch from bjp in lok sabha poll to aap in assembly poll be the “swing vote” that decide the winner in both case the bjp sweep all seven delhi ls seat in may 2019 the aap’s win in the assembly election now be indicative of the electoral power of this swing vote indian voter be member of our society they be the ordinary people we see all around u in our everyday live ideology be and be a vague and often remote concept for nearly all of them it be at best a label of identity but one whose actual content be often understand in very simple term thus a hindutva ideological position in actual practice devolve into the usual hatred for muslims and pakistan the distaste for “non veg” food and it eater and pride in the greatness of ancient india where everything have be invent 5 000 year ago similarly a leftist or left liberal ideological position be often reduce to a champion of religious and sexual minority it have lose it old association with workers’ right and therefore represent little else “i wake up at 5.30 be cook lunch for myself and take

majdoor’s be rarely hear the bitterness of disappointment in union and intellectual that come across in his word be not really be address by any party ideologies that claim to represent them have in practice fail them the mass of delhi voter who vote bjp in lok sabha and aap in assembly poll be clearly not very ideologically dogmatic in west bengal the bjp’s leap from nowhere in the picture to second place vie for first have come at the expense of the left party because the bulk of their voter simply switch from vote communist to vote for the bjp’s hindu nationalist it would appear that even after decade of communism there they be not very ideologically commit ideology be a luxury that few in india or the world can afford it be always a concern of only two kind of elite — the educate cultural elite and the political elite mean those who be actually involve in politics the moral universe and cultural live of the mass be rarely shape by ideology in india at least religion and caste remain powerful force which be why even cpi m leader in kolkata have to patronise durga puja celebration the mass in india typically support leader and party rather than ideology and they do so for instrumental and practical reason the same person who support cpi m can thus move quite seamlessly to support bjp because his or her own local and personal need be good answer by the latter often this need be link to issue of dignity identity politics of the bjp and of it opponent who champion other religious regional linguistic and cultural identity give many people who have little else to be proud of a sense of power and dignity since the search for respect call the “thymotic urge” be one of the motor of history the politics of identity will remain powerful what aap have prove with it win in delhi be that it may be possible for opponent of the bjp to find a new political path that do not counter identity with identity and ideology with ideology aap simply stick to school and hospital and low utility bill and run away from the battle of ideology and identity that enable bjp to polarise hindu vote kejriwal’s stance and it success will leave political party leader and strategist with

the rare unity of the anti caa protest excerpts you start write when you be quite young you be not yet 30 and you have three book of popular history out was this always plan like all child who seem to have an interest in write and with over enthusiastic parent who say ‘go follow your passion’ i write some atrocious poetry when i be 12 13. i write a teen novel that be completely plagiarise more seriously i be 19 20 when i discover the topic for my first book and that trigger it own interest a lot of the place i go to be because i need to be there for my research when i need the london archive i aim for a master’s in london i come to work in delhi because i need to use the archive here and in kerala everything be tailor around the book in that half decade. how do you choose the subject for your book i be draw to story that be not regularly tell the one that be neglect the first book be about a travancore queen who be essentially footnote and forget the second book be about the history of the deccan from the 13th century to the 18th because everyone talk about the marathas and the mughals and i say ‘hold on this be a fascinate universe in it own right even without the marathas and the mughals’ it deserve a storyteller on it own is the write process a difficult one do you write for long hour by the time i finish my first book i have lose 12 kg because all i do be write from the morning till about 9 or 10 in the night i sit in my room for a month to prepare the first draft have you ever wonder about the ideological spectrum of your reader when i write my first book i think the average age of reader would be 80 90. there be reader of that age but equally so many young people be read it be a great boost of confidence there be youth who pick up a 700 page book by an obscure writer on an obscure topic and price at rs 699 and they be will to read in term of political lean i think a lot of leftist and leave lean laypeople do read my book but so do the people on the right i haven’t have any issue partly because i keep channel open i talk to people on the right also i recently review vikram sampath’s book savarkar echoes from a forgotten past 1883 1924, in which i say a certain number of thing break it down to his phase of life whatever be my personal view when review a book my job be not to sit in judgement on whether he be a good or bad man my job be to see whether the book be well researched, the archive be touch upon whether the source have be critically analyse by the writer etc these be the thing i base my judgement on history also get politicise and people expect you to take side i find it very uncomfortable a work should stand on it own foot but expect the historian to make obvious which way his personal lean be be harmful in the long term it put wind in the sail of people who talk of ultra leftist clique or marxist clique there be no such clique across india today people of all social educational and political background be protest against the contentious citizenship law did these spontaneous protest surprise you none of u in college even look at the preamble to the constitution now it’s on placard and the young be own it even the architect of the legislation didn’t expect such protest i think they expect a few opposition party to make some noise a they do with article 370 in kashmir these protest be organic and spread on their own that’s remarkable kerala have be at the forefront of these protest it become the first state to move a resolution in the assembly and even file a plea in the supreme court against the caa how do you see that some people say these be optic but optic matter it’s about narrative and how you change public sentiment i think the kerala government’s attitude have be constructive a

journalist atul chaurasia hitesh shankar anant vijay and writer anu singh choudhary only hour before his session firstpost catch up with thanvi a he reflect on what ail indian journalism in the age of technology and contract culture do you think there a need to rethink one approach towards journalism in india today with the credibility of the country medium be constantly question by different quarter yes there be a need today to rethink our approach towards journalism in india we should rethink on the line of have forget our responsibility a journalist the way the medium behave in our country go against the basic of journalism that we be teach — of be particular about fact of ask question because journalist be expect to ask and keep ask question but we don t do that anymore you must have also see one of those viral video where a particular politician keep repeat that he have answer the reporter question we should definitely applaud the person who ask those question because this be a rare instance during a time when no one dare to ask question that too repeatedly it be only today morning that i be have a conversation with ravish kumar — who have come to my place for breakfast — when we discus certain thing pertain to the current political scenario we both agree that senior leader have become increasingly irresponsible in their behaviour and conduct at his session late in the day at the jaipur literature festival ravish go on to more elaborately expound on this tendency among the rule class in the country he mention that the prime minister of our country bluntly lie while speak at the ram leela maidan in delhi it be clearly a lie when he say that nrc wasn t something he have even discus early whereas there be previous statement make by him and by the home minister both inside and outside the parliament about the nrc follow the caa not a single news channel raise question on the prime minister lie so my point be the medium should ask question and not remain silent this be a bizarre situation which we haven t quite experience before silence be present before yes not like journalist in this country raise a lot of difficult question early — but now they be either afraid to speak up or have be buy off or a ravish say they ve all become a part of godi medium these be journalist sit in the lap of the government and politician different individual might have different reason for behave this way but if we be talk about the prevail situation in the country it should make u introspect on why this be the condition of the press if we have lose our will to ask question then we have essentially forget how to be journalist with change time politics technology and corporate culture how do one maintain the sanctity of journalism which be base on pursue and report fact objectively while be mostly own by corporate entity look technology have no bear on whether fact should be report accurately or not technology be just process what you be express whether through write or visuals it support our profession but when it come to the second part of your question it be true that the medium have be largely buy off by corporate entity see businessmen don t really care which political party or ideology be in power because government keep change and subsequently so do their loyalty and nexus however if this be the situation what be journalist to do at present the regulation of the wage board in our country have become totally irrelevant and defunct and the government have do nothing to ensure the implementation of say regulation or save the wage board but it be the government that have actually create the wage board in the first place there be the palekar award the manisana award bachawat award which be follow by newspaper if they didn t follow them the government would have to pressurise the medium firm into do so when i start work in the 80 the wage board be functional but eventually and slowly they be do away with and contract culture replace it it be the television industry that be to a great extent responsible for the system of contract along with bring in more money into news now the problem with contract be that they re tentative this culture enslave you even though you spend most of your wake hour work for your company if something go wrong you re kick out of your job it like a sword of damocles be hang over the head of journalist at all time if the journalist be always worry about save his job he will end up do whatever his employer want him to do so the only way a journalist can be save from this nightmare be when the government decide to do something about it but then the government itself have undo what it set out to do through the wage board whatever remain to be settle for these wage board legally continue to languish in the record of the supreme court the corporatisation of medium have only encourage this contract culture which in turn have make several journalist coward if the journalist be tell that he will be pay only when he obey the order of his employer what autonomy be he leave with suppose a reporter have buy a house or a car or have invest somewhere and have a family to look after — it obvious that he will automatically want to maintain status quo at his workplace to keep his life from fall apart so this policy have only aid in the process of keep the journalist frighten and silence not only have the government not do anything to correct this situation but it have also destroy the security provide by the wage board it have set up the threat of fake news be quite prevalent how much would you say be it the reader onus to seek out authentic source of news how much do this damage the credibility of the press a a democratic institution or do we see this a a fallout of indiscriminate use of technology and not something specific to the business of news the advent of fake news have happen with the advent of technology also i have say this repeatedly that social medium isn t the same a journalism — it largely a medium to express personal view but remember online journalism be a different thing altogether media organisation do use various social medium platform these day and some of them have team in place that be responsible for news curation fact checking, language and grammar check but in most case social medium only provide a channel for people to rant on you write whatever be on your mind — there no one to check your grammar language tone or fact so consequently it can t be term journalism in journalism anyone can t publish anything there be editor who check fact and language — this balance act be barely ever do on social medium however a i mention early online journalism be a completely different ballgame be vastly different from whatsapp facebook and twitter in the latter there space for lie too and that be where fake news mostly come in but now there be organisation like alt news that bust myth and do fact check in the presence of such entity people be aware and careful of spread false information in the fear that they ll be catch do it i feel such organisation and individual should step up and do more work and i be sure there will be more such platform in the future having say that there that much you can do to stop fake news from circulate there will be people in society who be go to lie and you may walk up to them and ask them not to but they will do so anyway and in order to prove their falsehood there should be some people or some machinery in place unfortunately such entity barely exist in our country today and the one that do be exception if there be more such organisation there will be le fake news hopefully when it come to hindi journalism in particular how would you say it have evolve over the past two decade in term of credibility and quality of reportage i feel hindi medium good day be a thing of the past there aren t many reporter put in honest effort and do credible reportage and research in hindi journalism it be almost dead small local story like some accident or event — information that you find on social medium these day anyway — be the one that you find in hindi newspaper nowadays television do have large scope at present but it approach mostly lack seriousness and tend towards entertainment for example the instance i mention early of the prime minister lie at the ram leela maidan — at least someone should ve go back check record compare footage from his speech and raise question on his contradictory statement but nobody be do this kind of homework or show enough courage to ask these question however i feel language and grammar have suffer the bad injury in hindi journalism earlier people would learn good hindi by read hindi newspaper because news be write in sound grammar and language but where do these good newspaper go show me one reputable hindi newspaper today that take language seriously i live in jaipur and over here hindi newspaper spell circle a 'cir kil'. i point this out to several editor and publisher but they continue to publish an incorrectly spell version of the word i can cite many other similar example journalists these day don t put in effort to fact check anymore or even find out the correct spell of a word so language have be a major casualty for hindi journalism after it fall from grace in time when political discourse be so severely polarise what role do you see the vernacular and local medium play in particular a an organ of democracy i don t see the local and the national medium do different job in case of local organisation however they definitely be bind by more restriction because government and capitalist force heavily control them they need to survive some way or the other but in case of large national level medium organisation that have wide circulation and a lot of money i believe they can organise themselves good and defy political force if and when require because at the end of the day it the editor who run a newspaper right but where be the editor but in case of small local newspaper they have to make plenty of compromise in order to survive and despite that they be often find take a stand on some social issue the great responsibility in this regard fall on the big player and it these major newspaper who be now make in road into the small more remote corner of india this wasn t the case back in our day when major newspaper would only operate out of big city now the same paper have different edition be publish at district levels. this have not only kill the small local newspaper but have also ensure that news from one district do not reach another district there heavy censorship go on with trivial local news be circulate within city since that be where they get all their advertisement and sponsorship from — from local businessmen and the government therefore i believe this question of local news outlet make a dent in the current socio political discourse doesn t hold much relevance if the big player be unable to make a difference how can the small one be expect to bring about any change india have fall 10 place to rank 51 on the global democracy index of 2019 which factor in freedom of press and freedom of speech among other civil liberty in general every regime have try to censor the medium in it own way how and why do you think the current dispensation be exceptional in this regard when it come to the way in which it be handle the press and various independent intellectual institution the central government have largely fail to deliver on most front and commitment that they make in their election manifesto they start with promise of control the economy nab black money circulation shout slogan of sabka saath sabka vikas promise to bring bullet train and smart city among other thing but eventually fail to fulfil most of them then they introduce measure like demonetisation which prove to be disastrous a well so in order to distract people from say failure the government have start devise mean of harassment where they intimidate individual who don t support them they either charge them with sedition or get them arrest or order an income tax raid on them while simultaneously carry out their agenda on kashmir surgical strike caa nrc, or other such issue journalists who dare to speak up be mark out and call different name or legal charge be bring against them some of them lose their job while writer who protest the kill of intellectual and fellow writer by return state sponsor award be malign with term like 'award wapsi gang or khan market gang how can journalist like politician and other public figure be make more accountable for their action and word especially if they re catch spread misinformation and foment tension between different group of people considering there have be multiple occasion in the past couple of year when certain journalist have be find do so the law can keep such thing in check our judiciary do have a lot of power to do so but in most instance out of the many that happen the case be quite trivial and irrelevant where one party say something to threaten or blackmail the other at other time someone charge someone else with defamation however if this issue of accountability have to be deal with an iron fist then the law have to be re examine and reframed for it to be effective the law of the land have remain the same since time immemorial and the common man face the brunt of it whereas the one who be suppose to be hold accountable have mean to wriggle out of such situation but in case of india i believe that more than the judiciary or the government — and i believe government shouldn t have any control over the medium whether for good cause or dishonest one — agency of the medium like the editors guild of india the news broadcasters association nba or even the press council of india should make themselves more effective in order to stave off such issue of accountability and corruption if medium body can t bring about a certain amount of self discipline, then no one can help them for instance an editor in chief of a television news channel who be catch seek a bribe of rs 100 crore be late put behind bar but even then you can t do much to change the situation you can t take his stature or designation away from him or keep him from be a prime time anchor so a body like the press council of india which be set up by the government itself do not have these power simply because the government have formulate law to that effect and the remain agency don t have power of censorship or any authority to demand the expulsion of such people from journalism therefore there barely any point in constitute such toothless body most hindi news channel on television be charge with create unwatchable content make a mockery of news and peddle a pro government narrative what be your thought on that they ve make a fool of themselves by do so what can modi ji do about it they could actually ask good question for example since narendra modi say people can be identify by their clothe why not question him on his clothe and ask him about his expensive suit since that be what people be suppose to identify him with ravish kumar in his session at the jaipur literature festival this year speak about how gandhi ji have shed his regular clothe so will you now identify gandhi ji from his clothe go ahead do it journalists have the right to ask such question but instead they ask aapne aisi fakiri kaha se paai aap toh sotey hi nahi hai what be this but shameless sycophancy and when they can t find journalist to do their bid they get hold of lyricist to do the job there a limit to such embarrass behaviour these be people who ve put u in trouble by not do their job honestly and be only conspire to distract u from press issue by destroy relationship with neighbour country and create divide between community within the country and yet there be people who refuse to hold them accountable for any of it and instead ask them pointless question finally during such politically turbulent time what do you think be the way ahead for the indian press that constantly under global scrutiny for fail to uphold the sanctity of the fourth estate i feel young journalist in our country lack proper education and train how many medium institute in india really do this job the faculty that they hire — what experience do they bring with them some news organisation have open their own train school and charge a hefty sum to train people to become journalist but these aren t very professional body encourage study and research in journalism where they investigate the various instance when pointless question be ask to a public figure or the many time the press fail to do it job properly journalism institute should do quality work and research but we don t have enough establishment of such calibre in our country we don t have place that can teach journalist how to use good language or help them learn morality ethic responsibility gender issue or even the law constitution governance and policy among other subject when a person go through such rigorous train he or she will at least be able to realise that a journalist shouldn t act in a manner that can cause embarrassment i believe such establishment should be there in every state my point be the state of education and train in journalism in our country be quite abysmal at present find late and upcoming tech gadget online on tech2 gadgets get technology news gadget review rat popular gadget include

muslims these be secular demand and we would be misread them if we think they proceed from communitarian affiliation alone without in any way repudiate their muslim identity — after all the collective

0	numbers game poll calculations a different kind of election with 37 rajya sabha vacancy fill up unopposed and a tough fight expect for the remain 18 seat here be a look at how party do the math to score a win rajya sabha election be usually a plan affair that rarely go off the script except for when they actually do like it happen three year ago when congress ’ ahmed patel narrowly beat the bjp candidate in gujarat after a lot of intrigue crossvoting and disqualification of mlas yet the element of surprise remain minimal in rajya sabha poll say sanjay kumar director at centre for the study of developing societies csds a think tank perhaps he be right after 55 new vacancy come up in the upper house of parliament 37 member get elect to the rajya sabha unopposed in poll hold on march 18 those elect have no opponent some of the key name include ncp chief sharad pawar union minister ramdas athawale and rajya sabha deputy chairman harivansh narayan singh the opposition in some state do not field any candidate in view of it low number of legislator in odisha four independent stand against the bjd nominee but their candidature be reject due to lack of minimum number of proposer the rulebook say 10 mlas need to propose the name of a candidate but the outcome may not be a predictable for the remain 18 vacant seat election for which be due this thursday march 26 regular vacancy make up nearly one third of rajya sabha seat usually 80 of the 238 seat election for which be hold every two year in contrast to casual vacancy that arise when a member resign be disqualify or die “but the one third number have be change over the year due to merger and creation of new state ” say a senior rajya sabha official on the condition of anonymity how be this contest go to shape up since multiple party will field candidate and an mla will grade and indirectly elect more than one candidate include those from the opposition and how different be the rajya sabha election process from the simple firstpast the post system of the lok sabha election haven’t we all read this definition “members of rajya sabha be elect by member of legislative assembly through proportional representation by mean of single transferable vote” without actually understand what it mean and how be the quota — or minimum valid vote require to win a seat — calculate to understand this let’s go back to gujarat march 26 will see contest for four rajya sabha seat in the bjp rule state the bjp with 103 mlas early field two candidate abhay bharadwaj and ramila bara it late field a third candidate — narhari amin a congress turncoat on the other hand the congress which have 73 mlas along with independent jignesh mewani be sure of win two of the four upper house seat but with the resignation of five mlas the party’s number have dwindle to 68 — four short of the require number of 72 to win two seat this have also reduce the strength of the gujarat assembly — from 182 to 177 each party now need 36 first preferential vote to win a seat and 72 to win two seat the bjp with 103 mlas need 108 vote 36 multiply by 3 to win three seat now cross vote and preferential vote may tilt the balance in favour of the bjp that be why the party field a third candidate “we be sure of win all three seat ” a senior bjp functionary tell et magazine following the resignation the congress have move 24 gujarat mlas to jaipur to ward of any chance of horsetrading it be clear gujarat will continue to see a close contest like it do in 2017 here be how the vote quota be calculate in a rajya sabha election in a state with more than one seat the quota be calculate by first multiply the number of mlas with 100 since each mla’s vote be deem to have a value of 100 through this formula the total value of vote in gujarat reach 17 700 177 x 100 this number be then divide by the number of vacancy plus one or 4 1 5 see quota formula below this give u 3 540 one be add to the quotient to reach the quota make it 3 541 since each mla have a value of 100 each candidate need the support of more than 35 mlas 3 541 divide by 100 and round off to win a seat this system of proportional representation through single transferable vote be use in an election where one voter have to vote for more than one candidate in gujarat one mla will indirectly vote for four candidate how while fill the ballot paper that have name of all candidate across party in fray the mla have to mark her order of preference against each candidate’s name — 1 be top preference call first preferential vote 2 be next and so on if the total first preferential vote be equal or more than the quota that candidate stand elect if the win candidate have excess vote these be transfer to their second choice mark number 2 if more than one candidate have surplus the large surplus be transfer first to further avoid wastage of vote if the requisite number of candidate still do not get elect the candidate low on the poll be exclude and his unexhausted paper be distribute among the continue candidate “exhausted paper” mean a ballot paper on which no further preference be record for a continue candidate in these election surplus vote transfer and elimination if applicable go on until enough candidate reach the quota to fill all the seat let’s take another example a state with 100 mlas have three rs vacancy and two party — p1 party with 60 mlas and p2 party with 40 mlas p1 field three candidate a b and c and p2 field d e and f in this case the quota will come to 2 501 which mean the support of more than 25 mlas for each candidate formula 100x100 3 1 1 during cast vote use ballot paper 60 mlas of p1 party choose candidate a a the first preferential vote b a second preferential vote and c a third preferential vote similarly 40 mlas of p2 party may mark candidate d a first vote e a second vote and f a third vote after one round of poll say candidate a be select then her 34 surplus vote be transfer to candidate b in the same round candidate d be also select and her 14 surplus vote be transfer to candidate e thus candidate a and d be elect but since there be three vacancy more round will be hold in the second round b be select automatically a she receive 34 surplus vote from a e be 12 short of quota and c f have no vote hence a b and d be select by proportional representation through single transferable vote if mlas from p1 party mark candidate of p2 party a number 4 5 or 6 then candidate from one party may be elect on transfer of vote from opposition party this happen in poll with multiple vacancy that require multiple round of surplus vote transfer hence party strategically ask their mlas to give not more than one choice so that their vote do not give an advantage to another party in the march 18 election on all 37 seat where the candidate win unopposed the opposition in those state do not have quota for even a single candidate let’s take the example of telangana which have two rajya sabha vacancy the rule ysr congress party field two candidate given the party’s strength of 151 mlas in the 175 member assembly it win both the seat the formula make the quota 5 834 or the support of around 59 mlas since opposition tdp have only 23 mlas there be no need of a contest there be some peculiar rule relate to rajya sabha poll for example only a violet sketch pen provide by the return officer should be use to mark the ballot in 2016 congress back candidate rk anand lose in the haryana rajya sabha poll after 14 congress vote be find invalid on account of use the wrong colour pen also the poll be not actually hold in the rajya sabha but in respective state assembly “we simply administer the oath of office ” say the rs official quote early interestingly the system of open ballot – where lawmaker be suppose to show their ballot to an authorise party agent before drop it the box    be introduce by the nda government in 1998 to avoid corruption during secret ballot open ballot become a norm follow a 2006 supreme court’s kuldip nayar versus union of india judgement by the same rule requirement of a “domicile” in the state concern for get elect to the council of state be delete even a it be believe that candidate from one party can be elect on transfer of vote from other party reduce the role of partisanship in the rajya sabha electoral process in practice each party devise a way to only help their candidate sail through the system of proportional representation via single transferable vote system be also use for elect the president of india the vice president and member of state legislative council the system be also use be the city election in the us ireland and australia some election in nepal pakistan and new zealand a debate continue a to whether proportional representation through single transferable vote be good than first past the post. advocates of proportional representation say it enable vote to be cast for individual candidate rather than for party and compare to winner take all first past the post system it reduce wastage of vote in this system the more the seat to be win the wide the distribution of vote for each seat for example in a three seat contest a candidate need roughly one third of vote to win a seat but in a seven seat poll any candidate who can get the support of around 14 of the vote either first preference or a combination of fpv and transfer lowerranked preference will win a seat “no system be foolproof even in first pastthe post, people be elect with thin margin ” say kumar of csds “think of the bsp in the 2014 lok sabha poll it get 20 vote share in up but do not win any seat this mean there be no voice in parliament for several lakh of voter who choose the bsp at the same time proportional representation be suit for an electoral college which be learn and educate ”come march 26 and the rajya sabha poll will turn into a slugfest for the 18 seat besides gujarat at stake at four seat in andhra pradesh three in rajasthan and mp two in jharkhand and one each in manipur and meghalaya with extra player in the fray in each of these seat the election math will keep change till the last minute depend on the number of valid vote cross voting, surplus transfer of preferential vote and rejection

1	former member of parliament general secretary of the congress and the billionaire heir to the one time house of gwalior jyotiraditya scindia decide to switch party and join the bhartiya janata party cause a mini earthquake across the political landscape ‘experts’ on 24×7 television medium and twitter go into a frenzy latch on to every piece of gossip and second hand information in their attempt to come to grip with the fast unfold event much of the ‘liberal’ medium try to paint an all too familiar picture of scindia a a young and upcoming leader who be ‘lost’ to the inept leadership of rahul gandhi and hard do by the machination of crook party veteran digvijaya singh and the madhya pradesh chief minister kamal nath on the other hand a section of the congress party’s support base and it leader label him a traitor and reconjured the memory of the betrayal of rani laxmibai by the house of scindias incidentally the invocation of this betrayal be a recurrent trope in former bjp chief minister shivraj singh chouhan’s speech who run an entire campaign in the last election with the slogan “maaf karo maharaj hamara neta shivraj” now of course all be forgive by the bjp also read jyotiraditya’s bjp move casts shadow over aide turned adversary krishnapal’s future the reason for scindia’s desertion however lie outside both these paradigm of emotive knee jerk reaction and need to be reconsider the flaw marginalisation thesis if we try and go by what we know definitely and not by conjecture a very different picture of the entire episode emerge the first theory be about the central leadership of congress be unresponsive however in his resignation letter he reveal that he have be consider this switch for the last year and therefore the suppose inaccessibility of rahul gandhi also do not hold water gandhi who have maintain a stoic silence through the entire episode but break it momentarily to make it be know to the public that of all people scindia could have call upon him at all time the other complaint in the medium be about the suppose political marginalisation of scindia within congress owe to digvijaya singh and kamal nath in truth however scindia have have an extraordinary career for such a young man in indian politics at just 49 he be a four term mp a two time union minister a cwc member in charge of western up and a power centre in madhya pradesh he could have choose to be the deputy chief minister like sachin pilot if he so wish when the congress ride back to power after 15 long year which strangely he do not here be another aspect to consider a close friend of rahul gandhi’s can never be marginalise within congress the theory be about him be the ‘face’ of the party which in plainspeak mean that the medium like him this cannot be contest he be the most telegenic leader in congress however there’s a universe of politics outside television studio this be the reason why when he decide to switch party an overwhelm majority of mlas decide not to jump ship with him starkly expose his limit regional influence in the state also read jyotiraditya scindia’s switch raises questions that we sidestep at our own peril given this fact it would be fair to assume that he wield power commensurate with his influence in any case the answer to end marginalisation in congress can never be to join the bjp which be an ideologically commit cadre base party with a whole galaxy of heavyweight entrench in the gwalior chambal region which be scindia’s area of influence scindia’s model of power the alternative explanation then would have to factor in the other big development that take place about a year ago – namely his electoral defeat in the general election at the hand of his own worker in his family fiefdom of guna scindia’s political clout be entirely base on his electoral invincibility and massive inherit wealth which guarantee him the position of the perpetual disburser of power and patronage to his loyalist in the wake of his 2019 election defeat that aura of invincibility be shatter immediately after that he break rank with his party to support the scrap of article 370 while three democratically elect former chief minister be summarily throw in jail this be follow by his support of the caa nrc, which be the most profound attack on the constitutional ideal of our republic two vision of politics scindia’s switch to the bjp then be the result of his inability to imagine a politics outside of power given his model of politics this be therefore a canny move on his part for the foreseeable future the bjp will be the dominant force in national politics which will ensure that he will once again be elevate to the position where he can be a patron and secure his other interest within a predictable matrix of power in delhi and the state if we look at politics a a career this move make perfect sense for he will be relatively insulate by the uncertainty of democracy also read congress should welcome the scindia treachery work for the gandhis’ exit the other vision of politics look at it a a movement this be a period of great churn in the country’s politics the entire opposition not only the congress would do well to reinvent itself a a movement for a new constitutional compact by engage in dialogue with the emergent force and most importantly remember who stand with them in these test time

1	jyotiraditya scindia departure from congress have not only reveal fault line within the party but also bring to fore a paralyse decision make process and disconnect between the congress high command and the reality on the grind firstpost speak with senior congress leader rashid alvi who have be an mp in both houses of the parliament a spokesperson of the party and be a member of priyanka gandhi vadra head congress advisory committee for uttar pradesh about scindia exit and what it mean for the party edited excerpt from the interview jyotiraditya scindia one of the most prominent next generation leader of your party have leave congress and join bjp he have say your party be in denial of the grind reality your comment it be very unfortunate i have to say two thing a far a scindia be concern he should not have take this step he should not have join the bjp if he have form his own party it would have be a different thing but at the same time we a in congress party be also at fault we should have give think to it and i think if we have talk with jyotiraditya a compromise be possible it have damage out party can you elaborate on what you mean when you say fault of the party behind jyotiraditya exit sonia gandhi be party president scindia a rahul gandhi have say be his friend from college day and could walk in his house any time he also have direct access to priyanka gandhi vadra then why they couldn’t sit and talk and resolve the issue actually i believe some person would have misguide the top leader that i think be the reason misguided whom sonia gandhi they would have create such a situation that jyotiraditya take this step but be it not a fact that scindia be feel leave out kamal nath continue to occupy state party president post despite the fact that he become the chief minister over a year and half ago shouldn’t scindia have be make madhya pradesh congress committee president it be my consider opinion that one man one post formula should be apply in the congress party so other people can also be accommodate if we have do it early then scindia would have be adjust a mpcc president or something why one person one post be not happen why so many vacancy of pcc chief be not be fill this should be do by high command i can’t say more than that one man one post formula should be implement immediately it be in the interest of the party scindia’s departure be be see a an indicator of the ill that have grip congress — a deep ideological and existential crisis could scindia have leave because he see no future in congress and also no future for congress congress have give so much to him he be a multiple term mp minister and general secretary he should not have leave i repeat if he have form his own party it would have be different but join a party which be on the other extreme of the ideological spectrum be different how can he change his ideology overnight but ideology be not an issue it seem you be very right ideology be not an issue that why people don’t trust politician the crisis of confidence in congress be happen at two level first party leader take position different than state by the leadership and even quit and second people continue to lose their confidence in congress which be reflective in the election result no people have vote congress to power in several state we win madhya pradesh rajasthan chhatisgarh and perform well in haryana jharkhand and maharashtra but i agree that congress party need to do a lot sonia gandhi have be interim congress president do you think congress need a new full time president yeah definitely according to constitution of congress a permanent president should be there i wouldn’t hesitate to say that even the congress working committee cwc member should also be elect a prescribe in the party constitution so that the impression of inner democracy be give to the people and maintain among the worker of party who should be congress president it be wrong to say who should be congress president everybody may have different like for example if you ask me i will say priyanka gandhi should be congress president but there be a party constitution the party president should be elect a per prescribe norm many in your party be root for the return of rahul gandhi a the party president surely so many leader and lot of party worker want rahul gandhi to return to the party president post and take charge some people want sonia gandhi to continue some people want priyanka gandhi some people have give statement that someone outside of the gandhi family should be the president coming to the minority plank of the party the minority community favour congress for decade but now they have go against congress wherever they have an option delhi election be the late example you rule here for 15 year you have several important muslim leader but the community have completely desert congress and side with the aam aadmi party aap definitely the minority should be give adequate representation in the party in state and at the central party structure the feel among the minority be that they be not get their due representation in delhi we be expect that both the majority and the minority community would support u but 95 percent muslims support aap i don’t know whom should i blame all over delhi hundred of hoard of congress party be there but no muslim face be there the party should give due think to it why do you think congress fail to take up challenge pose by narendra modi and amit shah as some of your party colleague have say the sultanate have go but they be still behave like sultan that obviously imply for the top leadership in your party what be the way forward for congress the ideology of amit shah and narendra modi be very dangerous they will destroy the country and be destroy the country but at the same time i have to say that they (modi shah) be 24x7 leader they be work all the time they work very hard for their ideology and for their goal if we have to fight the bjp and modi then we have to work like them and fight like them then we can convince the people of the country to give u a chance we be do our best and we be not go to

singh of the delhi high court take up a petition ask for firs to be file against three bjp leader anurag thakur parvesh verma and kapil mishra for hate speeches’ that the petitioner allege spark off the riot in new delhi the evidence present be video of three such speech include the now infamous desh ke gaddaron ko goli maaro saalon ko shoot the traitor ’ chant at public rally a well a verma’s allegation that the peaceful shaheen bagh protester would rape your sister and daughter and kill them’ and his insinuation that if the bjp lose the delhi election even modiji and amit shah won’t be able to save you’ a crucial moment come when justice muralidhar ask solicitor general tushar mehta represent the delhi police why firs have not already be file mehta reportedly say that the situation be currently too delicate’ and that firs would be file at an appropriate stage’ the exchange that follow centre on a simple fact when you don’t register an fir ’ note justice muralidhar a wrong message go out people aren’t deter from repeat such provocation ’ the police’s failure to crack down on such incendiary statement likely play a significant role in what be to come consider the case of mishra on january 22 and 23 while campaign in new delhi mishra describe the assembly election a an india pakistan conflict’ say that the aam aadmi party and the congress have set up a mini pakistan at shaheen bagh and that whenever traitor raise up pakistan in india patriot would raise up hindustan ruling that mishra have violate the model code of conduct mcc on january 25 the election commission ec slap him with a 48 hour campaign ban nonetheless a month late mishra be back at it on february 23 in a speech at a rally in jafrabad call to protest against anti caa protester who be block road in the city mishra issue an ultimatum with a senior police officer stand alongside him mishra say i say to the dcp stand next to me on everyone’s behalf until us president donald trump’s visit to india

that deadline never come to pas three day late score of new delhi’s citizen have be murder by their communally enrage neighbour mishra be not alone in such speech the ec have also haul up verma and thakur in late january the former for his they will rape your sister and daughter remark and for describe delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal a a terrorist and the latter for lead crowd in the desh ke gaddaron’ chant the ec have rule that both have aside from transgress the mcc also violate the representation of the people act 1951 which carry a maximum punishment of three years’ imprisonment nonetheless both be only serve with campaign ban contrast this with instance in which authority have clamp down harshlyjust a few month ago comedian kunal kamra be ban from air travel for heckle a journalist with the ban endorse by minister for civil aviation hardeep singh puri similarly in 2016 jnu’s kanhaiya kumar be book for seditious remark and just last month a nine year old’s mother be send to prison because her child perform in a school play which be describe by authority a seditious’ dr harish shetty a psychiatrist at the hiranandani hospital in mumbai say that communal material can most certainly influence people india be an angst drive society rumours become belief easily because of this reason angst be able to overshadow the pre frontal cortex in our brain which help u discern information and tell u what to trust and what to ignore say dr shetty angst become our primary source of express primitive emotion eventually it can lead to violent action anecdotal evidence be aplenty for instance the men who open fire at shaheen bagh and in jamia millia islamia university in early february be find to be member of facebook group that regularly circulate video and message about muslims harm hindus’ there be no monopoly over hate speech in january anti caa activist sharjeel imam be hear exhort protester to cut northeast off from india and be book under an anti terror law for hate speech at an anti caa rally in kalaburagi karnataka on february 15 aimim leader waris pathan invoke a vision of hindu muslim clash we might be only 15 crore but remember we be enough for the remain 100 crore what instance like these also highlight be that define hate speech’ can be a tricky matter manoj tiwari mp from northeast delhi and president of the bjp’s delhi unit say there should be an independent commission to decide what constitute hate speech while there be no law explicitly define this concept several section of the indian penal code include 295a 298 and 505 1 and 2 prohibit certain form of speech the former two proscribe act and word deliberately intend to outrage religious feel and the latter two penalise statement rumour or report that could cause public mischief enmity hatred or ill will. the criminal law amendment bill 2018 have also attempt to establish rule in this regard section 153c of this bill which have yet to be pas prescribe two year of imprisonment and a fine for those who use gravely threaten word or advocate hatred’ on the ground of religion race caste or community among others for the moment the status quo remain with solicitor general mehta’s appropriate stage’ yet to arrive though justice muralidhar have demand a response from the delhi police about the file of firs against bjp leader within 24 hour eyebrow be raise when he be transfer to the punjab haryana high court the next day though the central government clarify that the transfer order be issue on february 12 week before the riot break out a new bench comprise chief justice d n patel and justice c hari shankar give the centre a four week breather with the case to be hear next on april 13 however on march 2 the supreme court agree to hear a petition on the same matter on march 4 though it note that there be limitation to it power’ to control such violence why be the delhi police so inept in it response there’s a reason the delhi police be call the country’s most pamper police force the union home ministry foot it rs 8 619 crore annual budget for a force of over 80 000 policeman for comparison consider the rs 3 656 crore neighbour state haryana spend on it 56,747 strong force an august 2019 study by nonprofit agency common cause and lokniti centre for the study of developing societies a new delhi base think tank find the delhi police to be india’s best when it come to staff infrastructure and use of budget’ none of these be visible when it come to handle the national capital’s bad outbreak of hindu muslim clash in 70 year the police fail to anticipate the steady build up to the four day orgy of violence which lead to 49 death in northeast delhi’s communal tinderbox brickbat alley stones strew on a jafrabad road after the hindu muslim clash among their early failure be not prevent the sit in at the jafrabad metro station by anti caa protester on february 22 this be compound by the lack of action against bjp leader kapil mishra the next day a he fulminate against the protester in fact mishra serve an ultimatum to the delhi police on have the protester remove from the jafrabad and chand bagh area and he do it with the dcp of northeast delhi district ved prakash surya stand next to him within a few hour of mishra’s rally violent clash erupt in northeast delhi why do the delhi police supposedly india’s fine fail it’s a failure of the police leadership say prakash singh former director general of police of uttar pradesh police commissioner amulya patnaik have go under a cloud at the end of his career other police veteran be equally unsparing of the role play by their former colleague former delhi police commissioner ajai raj sharma accuse the force of allow the situation in northeast delhi to snowball and turn into a riot even the shaheen bagh sit in should not have be allow in the first place once it continue it generate communal feel which escalate during state election this communal situation culminate in the riot he say in a tv interview nine vehicle and an eatery be burn at karawal nagar a char park lot in shiv vihar photo by bandeep singh most senior police officer even those who believe in patnaik concur with the assessment it be a monumental failure on the part of the police commissioner say another serve officer of dgp rank he display indecisiveness inaction and sheer lack of leadership quality in not have the moral courage to protect delhi’s citizen he be always a submissive character submit to political authority never lead from the front patnaik who retire on february 29 defend his record he commend his officer for prevent the riot from spread through the city the delhi police contain the violence within 12 police station of northeast delhi and prevent it spread to the other 194 police station but for the delhi police’s action the situation could have be bad he say the police patnaik say disperse the mob on the night of february 22 and 23 during pro  and anti caa protest and deploy special commissioner of police satish golcha to monitor the situation on the 24th on february 25 the police use teargas a lathi charge. i be present in northeast delhi on february 24 25 and 26 by that time the situation have begin to return to normal if a he say the police be do it job where do the violence break out in the initial two day the police be man the main street and intersection where the crowd have gather the bylanes of northeast delhi be very difficult to penetrate it be here that the maximum violence happen say patnaik the police themselves be target by the mob head constable ratan lal be shoot dead and in another incident dcp amit sharma sustain serious injury on february 24 after be beat by a mob a 26 year old ib staffer ankit sharma be murder after be repeatedly stab and his body dump in a nearby drain these attack a policeman point out might have be a result of their lose the monopoly over coercion and violence in control public disturbance it should have resort to prompt action in what clearly be extraordinary circumstance the police should have resort to the disproportionate use of force to quell the violence say former ips officer uday sahai when face with a clear case of communal riot involve two community a happen in northeast delhi the police have to resort to maximum possible force to quell the violence and change the course and direction of the situation the police have to face the violence and crush it so that further outbreak of violence be prevent add another serve commissioner rank officer of the delhi police delhi follow the comissionerate system of police where senior officer say an acp or dcp do not need permission from a district magistrate to take a policy decision such a use teargas or a lathi charge, carry out arrest or even fire shot this system work well during normal time but it can completely collapse in time of a major crisis such a a communal conflagration this be because it do not have the mechanism of check and balance the magisterial system in state have explain a chief secretary rank officer in a key hindi heartland state patnaik the city police commissioner since january 2017 be due to retire on january 31 but be give a one month extension in light of the delhi assembly election but it be hard to miss the steady erosion in the public image of the delhi police in recent month last november after lawyer in the tis hazari court thrash their comrade thousand of uniform policeman lead a protest march to their own police headquarter shout we want justice in december the force fail to evict the protester at the shaheen bagh sit in, allow the situation to become communally charge on december 15 the police be accuse of high handedness in clash with student at jamia millia islamia university on january 5 they be accuse of inaction after goon go on a rampage in jawaharlal nehru university then in the run up to the assembly election in delhi on february 8 a divisive political campaign harden sentiment along religious line and yet the delhi police which have direct link to the union home ministry via the lieutenant governor the home secretary and the home minister be catch unawares when the communal cauldron begin boil on the eve of us president donald trump’s visit a deputy commissioner of police acknowledge that they have weak human intelligence about the (anti caa) protest the police also have little clue about the pile up of arm and illegal ammunition local area dcps shos acps and the special branch of the delhi police be suppose to gather human intelligence by network with the local community and religious leader from both community especially when there be fear of a communal clash brew beginning march 1 the delhi police have a new chief s n srivastava by march 2 the police have register 369 firs and arrest or detain 1 284 people for the violence new officer have be post in northeast delhi whose main job be to fight rumour reduce the trust deficit between the community and also the police trust can be break in a matter of minute rebuild it take forever it could be equally true of delhi’s police’s dent public image the late play left amit shah arrive in parliament feb 27 nsa ajit doval visit the riot affect area in n e delhi feb 26 why be the home ministry’s response inadequate even a the violence in northeast delhi spiral out of control and the delhi police struggle to control the rampage mob there be a high authority who could have step in union home minister amit shah not only do the delhi police directly report to him but shah also have under him a force of over 1 million a part of seven central arm police force this include the rapid action force and the specialise riot control wing of the crpf on february 24 when the clash between the pro  and anti caa mob turn into full fledge riot shah be in ahmedabad with prime minister narendra modi and key cabinet member to welcome us president donald trump home ministry official admit the ministry’s preoccupation with the trump visit play a significant role in their slow reaction to the riot the home ministry be the administrative ministry of the delhi police but the police commissioner be the magistrate he have full power to call the army and additional force say former home secretary g k pillai the standard procedure be clear you have to crush disturbance with an iron hand by issue shoot at sight order and impose curfew these action be clearly not take by the delhi police in the initial hour of the violence it be unclear how the other functionary in the chain of command lieutenant governor anil baijal home secretary ajay kumar bhalla and finally shah react to the crisis ultimately it take two visit to northeast delhi by national security advisor ajit doval on february 25 and 26 to reassure local the situation be under control one major reason behind the police failure may also be the over centralisation of authority in the home ministry after shah take over in 2019 shah be sharp and it be good to have his direction in crucial matter say an officer but the downside to it be that when he be busy like during trump’s visit the official down the chain begin to flounder while wait for his order this be what happen in this case too shah should have delegate official to deal with the situation what’s more home ministry official perhaps also ignore advance warn on the riot student activist umar khalid accuse of raise anti india slogan in jnu in 2016 have tell a public rally in amravati maharashtra on february 17 that when trump come the anticaa protester would hit the road in protest the intelligence bureau should have smelt a rat and take corrective step say an mha official who do not want to be name shah himself have be conspicuously silent on the subject of the riot since the riot opposition leader have repeatedly disrupt proceed in parliament demand shah’s resignation even senior leader in the bjp be of the opinion that shah should have issue an unambiguous statement express regret for the police failure and the riot shah himself be unavailable for comment however those speak on his behalf have their own take on the event they emphasise that it be radical islamic force that be bend on disturb the peace that trigger the riot rather than inflammatory speech by political leader asource close to shah say the home minister’s preoccupation with the trump visit be use by the radical islamic force to inflame the situation in jafrabad and trigger the riot in fact if shah have not intervene and rein in the police force after the death of ratan lal delhi police head constable and ankit sharma intelligence bureau staffer it could have be bad for the muslim mob after all some 1 000 bullet be fire from private weapon in the first three day of the riot the police could have retaliate strongly but do not in fact a main post riot criticism have be that the police do not use enough force to disperse the rioter former bsf director general prakash singh believe the police fail to anticipate the design of radical islamic force but he also blame the police for it very slow response which he believe be due to the force be unnerve by the repeat medium attack on it after the incident of violence at jnu jawaharlal nehru university and jamia millia islamia the police be either accuse of be a silent spectator or be too violent in it response then as singh say the police be very indecisive despite the clear cut signal and there be severe intelligence failure too with a force of 90 000 personnel and trump not have any public engagement in the capital the delhi police be well equip to deal with the situation but it be completely catch by surprise by the time it come up with an effective response it be too late even shah singh say react too slowly he should have have a hand on approach why do the political leadership fail peace out delhi cm arvind kejriwal with aap colleague at gandhi’s samadhi in rajghat feb 25 the absence of the aam aadmi party aap in the wake of the violence be glare the party have sweep to power in the delhi assembly election a second successive time

0	in the backdrop of opposition party leader and activist criticise the move justice ranjan gogoi have defend the narendra modi government move to nominate him to the rajya sabha only four month after his retirement a the chief justice of india he link the nomination to the process of nation building. this be what he say in guwahati i accept it since i be confident that the legislature and the judiciary must at some point of time work together for nation building. my presence in the parliament would be an opportunity to underline the view of the judiciary before the lawmaker and vice  versa there be no law or constitutional provision that prohibit such a nomination nor be this an unprecedented decision by the government still it be not a common practice that a government nominate or appoint a former supreme court judge or even a high court judge to some office within month of her or his retirement but there be a recommendation of the law commission of india that consider the question of such nomination and appointment before form a negative opinion it be the 14th report of the law commission of india and be make in 1958 when pandit jawaharlal nehru be the prime minister of the country in paragraph 28 of the report the law commission say we have notice the only bar impose on a judge of the supreme court who have retire be that he shall not thereafter plead or act in any court or before any authority in the result some supreme court judges have after retirement set up chamber practice while some others have find employment in important position under the government we have grave doubt whether start chamber practice after retirement be consistent with the dignity of these retire judge and consonant with the high tradition which retire judge observe in other country paragraph 29 of the same report of the law commission be more direct say but there can be no doubt that it be clearly undesirable that supreme court judges should look forward to other government employment after their retirement explaining the reason for why supreme court judge should resist such offer from the government the law commission report say the government be a party in a large number of cause case in the high court and the average citizen may well get the impression that a judge who might look forward to be employ by the government after his retirement do not bring to bear on his work that detachment of outlook which be expect of a judge in case in which government be a party we be clearly of the view that the practice have a tendency to affect the independence of the judge and should be discontinue the law commission conclude this report be never implement justice ranjan gogoi head the bench of the supreme court that decide politically volatile case such a the

the notion that the bjp be a party of the hindi heartland try to foist itself on the state shah’s visit be also mean to remove any suspicion in the mind of the local functionary of a covert bjp deal

population respond in the affirmative to have participate in conversation — the maximum with friend — a special emphasis be lay on start a dialogue with relative and those who be unaware of the act a 30 year old male participant in the study state that the fight to change mentality begin with those around thereby summarise the emotion of many others consuming newspaper article news on television channel and leverage social medium to consume repost news around the issue emerge a the next most common mean of engagement interestingly in addition to consume secondary source of information respondent report engage with the issue by read the caa along with the nrc and the cab and the indian constitution a well a fact check and collate credible information to curb misinformation thus gain a complete understand of the issue emerge a a crucial step in the engagement process the use of art a a medium of expression and engagement emerge strongly with various citizen note their participation in open mics street play create street art and write protest poetry signing petition and attend protest be two more way in which citizen action be take place around caa and or nrc reasons for attend anti caa and or nrc protest for citizen who choose to attend the anti caa and or nrc protest a unanimous reason for attend be their belief that the policy be unconstitutional and discriminatory towards certain minority group and it be a citizen’s duty to speak up against such “open injustice” people express that the discriminatory nature of the act be what motivate them to stand up against “unconstitutional infringement of their rights” in order to “reclaim the constitution reclaim democracy and re establish collective humanity” a 42 year old male respondent explain this further say that “citizens be the last line of defence when the state be take an iron rod to the constitution spine ” while one part of the population feel protest be useful to establish one’s presence to be hear to show solidarity and establish strength in number another part of the population feel it’s the helplessness of not know how else to engage in meaningful action that have drive them to participate in protest what bind both these motivation to attend a protest be the big sentiment which say that “staying neutral at the time of oppression be stand with the oppressor ” a part of the sample express disagreement with the rule government’s economic policy and believe caa and or nrc be distraction from the real and more press issue such a economy unemployment and climate change in contrast a big portion of the sample disagree with the government’s political ideology claim it be the “divisive politics of the rule party to divide along religious lines” that have drive them to attend protest basis the survey the feel of disagreement with the rule government’s economic policy and political ideology seem to be on the rise push citizen to believe that the caa have “merely galvanise a public dissent which have be build up ” another strong reason behind attend protest that emerge be the state’s use of violence to suppress dissent and shut down citizen action include for those who have not previously join the protest respondents believe the action of the government their dismissive attitude towards protest citizen and the violence and police brutality use against student be not acceptable a 27 year old female respondent from kolkata note “in time of dire hopelessness about the state of affair protest serve a a motivational factor — meet like mind people who re will to fight for a good cause keep your spirit alive ” reasons for stay away from the protest the response around reason for not attend protest range from logistical challenge to concern for personal well being. a majority of the non attendee in our sample explain that there be no protest be organise in their geographical location this be largely the opinion for non residential indians nris and citizen live in remote town in india further there emerge a section of people who wish to attend but could not due to lack of support from family – especially in case of minor and woman conflict work hour travel and other commitment it be also observe that the presence of fear around attend such protest due to their unpredictable nature and tendency to turn violent along with the lack of a fellow companion serve a deterrent to participate in them altogether in comparison to the above sentiment there be a segment of the sample who believe protest be not useful but instead “are inconvenient turn violent and disrupt the daily life of citizens” citizens express hesitation to attend protest a they believe protest be largely politicise and “take the large tone of history and religion which take away from the main focus they believe if protest be focus around environmental issue and the economy then they would be more likely to attend a small segment of the non attendee express that instead of protest they prefer to take action through sign petition collaborate with professional work on the act and engage in compassionate and patient dialogue with others lastly protest fatigue and lack of clarity around their stance emerge a two additional reason behind citizen be hesitant to engage even continually with protest the latter be explain further by a 30 year old female respondent from udaipur “i have certain view and stance but i would not be sure enough about them to protest on either side pro or anti i be find it hard to discern truth from fake news in the current climate to stay well inform ” questions citizen want to ask the government police and protest organiser as a part of the survey respondent be request to write any additional question they have for the state the police or the organiser of pro and anti protest besides any other stakeholder the maximum number of question come in for the government follow by question for the police for the police respondent express sentiment similar to those voice by a 22 year old male participant from chandigarh who ask “how be we expect to propagate the ‘police exist to protect us’ narrative after what happen at the protest ” for the government on the other hand while one respondent question why the rule party do not host open debate and engage in dialogue with citizen another

0	the music be vastly different from those of the previous performance that even at the cit road grind in calcutta it be a song that re energise the audience at the carnival against fascism in january which turn the protest against the new set of citizenship rule into a celebration of democracy and free speech a music band that even sing a sylheti song – it take a while for the eager young attendee to swing to the lyric that sound familiar and yet so alien in the audience i saw filmmaker ronny sen who have root in silchar run to the front of the stage whale in the pond a young band comprise of sourjyo shireen and deep take the stage towards the end of a long even and turn the spotlight to the arrival of a fast train and a 1961 incident in assam’s barak valley region let’s go back to that story from the mid 1960s, bengalis in assam have rise in protest against the imposition of assamese a the only official language of the state for most bengalis include sylheti speaker in the barak valley the right to speak one’s mother tongue be take away in independent india be unacceptable it be a natural reaction from a community that have just survive a violent partition and have fight a language war in east pakistan in 1951 against the imposition of urdu a the only medium of instruction the protest across assam have by and large be peaceful in may 1961 however thing take a different turn police fire indiscriminately without warn on a group of peaceful demonstrator squat at a railway station in silchar the fire say a commission of a group of eminent lawyer investigate the incident be ‘reckless brutal and absolutely without any semblance of justification’ and in violation of police manual no emergency or contingency have arise and there be no danger to public security or loss of life or property for which this extreme measure be take it add eleven people be kill in the fire the song in sylheti — a language speak by many bengalis — narrate this incident of police brutality at the tarapur railway station in assam but only in the chorus the centrepiece of song be the story of the arrival of a fast train but ‘aaij bhagle kalke amra nai which loosely translate to ‘if we run today we won’t be here tomorrow’ immediately take the clue in back to the violent politics around language identity and citizenship in assam the precursor to the present nationwide search for illegal migrant the fear about sylhet sylheti not only take the audience back in time to the 60 but it also reignite memory of a sylhet when it be a district of an undivided india and a district unwanted by the assamese before 1947 assamese political leadership want the bengali speak district of sylhet to be partition out of an independent india to save their idea of a pure and homogenous upper caste assam by then assam have already witness a line system that allow muslim migrant from east bengal’s mymensingh and rangpur district to settle only in some demarcate area as historian sujit chaudhuri point out congress leader from assam gopinath bordoloi tell the british cabinet mission in 1946 “assam would be quite prepare to hand over sylhet to eastern bengal ” chaudhuri write “the assam pradesh congress committee in 1945 in it election manifesto state ‘unless the province of assam be organise on the basis of assamese language and assamese culture the survival of the assamese nationality and culture will become impossible the inclusion of bengali speak sylhet and cachar and immigration or importation of lac of bengali settler on wasteland have be threaten to destroy the distinctiveness of assam and have in practice cause many disorder in it administration ’ these be the initial seed of hatred against bengalis and muslims that be already translate into policy and would late evolve into target violence against the community between 1979 and 1985 the assam agitation an anti foreigner agitation infamously go after bengalis reside in the state in 1983 accord to some account at least 3 000 bengali speak muslims be kill during that agitation in nellie the assam accord be sign in 1985 and give rise to a new set of citizenship rule by that time the barak valley of which silchar be a part have already be at the centre of many fight about illegal migrant bengalis and assamese language and culture slowly but surely it have also transform itself into a catchment area for the polarise politics that drive the citizenship amendment act caa in india many people in the region have turn bharatiya janata party supporter those who oppose be in the minority when try to find out more about the event at the tarapur railway station i reach out to an eyewitness to the police fire the person insist on first know my position on the national register of citizens nrc that have already mark 1.9 million ‘indians’ a non citizen and keep them in a dangerous limbo my opposition to it turn out to be a big disappointment for her that my family have root in mymensingh and jessore district in bangladesh add to that disappointment “you should support the nrc ” i be tell the dangerous politics of polarisation have coopted people who might have suffer during partition and turn this place into a big catchment area for those who want to push nrc national population register npr and caa what be anti bengali at one point have now become anti muslim and this be in perfect coordination with the bjp’s politics and divisive regional aspiration the song in two time space — 2015 when the train arrive and so do the exercise of a national register of citizens update and 1961 when the shoot happen — capture this co option. co option of a neglected barak valley barak valley even though a part of assam for the long time be neglect by it own state government accord to it resident not anymore there be proactive announcement of scheme and there be some development on the surface this include fast train a well there be a certain romanticism around infrastructure in the region and this be where the

be now supporter of the bjp wait to see a fast train arrive at the station “the previous f   ing government take all our money all these year promise u broad gauge line and they’ll get away with it ” go the translate lyric as the song proceed in the chorus there be a constant reminder of the police brutality and the language war that this region witness in the 60 “they come to scare u with the sound of their gun my blood freeze but i won’t let them take away my identity no i won’t ” with such lyric it connect to the citizenship politics and protest across india sourjyo who write the song and be from silchar be direct about the politics of opportunism and muslim hatred in barak valley “i saw friend i grow up with and some member of my extend family a well slowly turn into vocal supporter of the bjp ” he say “on a big scale the entirety of silchar fell in love with modi after they introduce broad gauge railway line i really want to poke fun at that blind hero worship and the verse do deal with that ” he point out the strange turn of event at the same railway station where people go to garland the first broad gauge train and thereby usher in the “modi lovefest” also witness perhaps silchar most historic event in 1961 “so it just make sense for me to make the chorus about that and highlight the hypocrisy of a community which be othered 60 year ago and which resist a rabid nativist government to completely forget their own history and accept a rabid nativist govt 60 year late now completely comfortable with the othering the muslims ” in 2019 general election the

his government’s work people do just that not because they suddenly turn indifferent to the pull of hindutva but because they recognise the performance of the aap government where do this electoral

he say the party have vote against the caa in parliament and he have oppose it in every rally and interview ” the report state a disingenuous effort it be disingenuous – in the face of that evidence a well a kejriwal’s repeat full throated criticism of the caa and nrc on television during town hall in the lead up to february 8 – to suggest that he have not take a position on the issue what his ideologically inflect critic mean to say be that he didn’t take the position they want him to yes he didn’t run an ideological campaign playing into the bjp’s hand would only have ensure aap’s defeat one could ask in turn how hand over delhi to the bjp would have strengthen the large ideological battle against the politics of hindutva furthermore a journalist jyoti punwani demonstrate after the result in delhi there be much to be say for keep one’s ear to the grind instead of channel the same radical piety left liberal circle have cling to for year “delhi’s vote ​had just get over when i

hindutva’ in a country where a majority of people – of all faith – be deeply religious if go to a temple and place garland be a symptom of political and electoral hindutva then surely the same can be say of those who mobilise islam or buddhism for political purpose anyone who claim that public display of religious faith set new standard for politician in india or that those standard be in and of themselves example of collusion with hindutva must have either be sleep or blissfully look away from the landscape of indian politics for at least the past century also read aap’s big victory here’s what the polling data reveals the point be explicitly not that aap or kejriwal’s politics be flawless they have take objectionable uncomfortable position in the past they also hold on to idea of nationalism that many of u myself include would be skeptical of but they have also show a great capacity to be open to debate and change than most political party they field candidate like atitshi and amanatullah khan who win by a landslide in okhla if their critic be actually interest in advance the fight against a fascist hindu right they would recognise the complexity entail in that fight as it

surge may not be enough to oust the incumbent government the congress field it leader rahul gandhi and priyanka gandhi vadra to attack the aap and the bjp the saffron party partly rely on prime minister speech in both houses of parliament to reach out to the voter and partly entrust home minister amit shah and delhi bjp leader to lead the charge and aap on the other hand trust arvind kejriwal and manish sisodia to hold the fort the aap key plank appear to be development the bjp nationalism and caa while congress settle for attack the former two on almost all count but overall this

-1	as we get use to the spectacular victory of the aam aadmi party aap in the delhi election it be important to also take note of the characterisation of the win by it leader a an endorsement of what they term a their ‘politics of change’ they insist that this model of policymaking have mark a shift from the politics of vacuous promise to one of work on the grind however even a one grant the aap leader this boast it be equally important to note that the change in politics begin a little early and for a different set of reason but let u first have a look at the salient mean of the delhi poll chief minister arvind kejriwal realise early that his strong electoral plank be his government’s accomplishment in the area of social welfare — provision of affordable education healthcare water and electricity — and that his party’s chief rival the bharatiya janata party bjp have nothing to offer on this front the bjp he understand would thus seek to draw him into an agenda which have give it several victory a programme feature communal hatred masquerade a nationalism the passage of the citizenship amendment act caa and the project of national register of citizens national population register set the background for the bjp’s characteristically aggressive campaign the protest against these symbolise by shaheen bagh give it further context mr kejriwal wisely choose to fight the election on his own rather than on the bjp’s term support across section it be remarkable that the aap receive support from affluent colony like greater kailash vasant vihar a well a colony of the underprivileged like govind puri and seelampur the party gain approval of both the highly educate voter in new delhi and south delhi and the supposedly illiterate villager clearly voter in the rich area do not choose mr kejriwal for give them free water and electricity but over something big these be issue that concern them but not them alone in define the nation this concern begin with a visible almost forcible redefine of the nation by the bjp along the path of ‘hindu rashtra’ this be not the path indians have inherit from their history which have always celebrate their civilisation’s pluralism there be also concern over the bjp’s brazenly partisan use of the state apparatus include police and bureaucracy unprovoked thrash of student at jamia millia islamia by policeman and the latter’s protection to goon with mask face who enter the jawaharlal nehru university jnu be widely witness on tv channel for day and meet with public condemnation incidentally there have not be a single arrest over the jnu incident so far protests against the caa a well a in response to police action and inaction take place in civil society — in the form of silent passive non violent satyagraha march and sit ins, especially with woman at the forefront shaheen bagh become a marker for such act of resistance that the protest become widespread all over the country from the invisible corner of small town to other metro bring the large issue to the forefront these protest be unconnected with either political party or electoral battle and therefore leave the government resourceless it be this attempt by the narendra modi amit shah duo to fundamentally alter the character of the nation and the civil society’s resistance to their design that have bring about a change in the pursuit of politics shaheen bagh form the centrepiece of the bjp’s campaign in delhi with hate fill slogan by it top leader and second ring politician like anurag thakur and parvesh verma act a a counter to mr kejriwal’s focus on social welfare the bjp clearly make the election a referendum for it caa nrc npr and for it communal vitriolic in other word it version of nationalism the voter respond with their verdict the youth desert the bjp the big loss to the bjp’s support base in this election be from the youth until a year ago a portion of india’s young generation form the unquestioning adore fan base of mr modi even if they be not commit to the bjp or train in rashtriya swayamsevak sangh rss shakhas however the caa have make them aware of the unabashedly divisive politics of the government head by mr modi and they have refuse to fall for it here a very interest indicator be the fact that the bjp’s vitriol in public be now be meet with roar of disapproval from the crowd the youth be at the forefront of this condemnation of the bjp’s ‘divide and rule’ policy and they have voice their disapproval through ballot power will the delhi election persuade the bjp to abandon or even modify it strategy of spread hatred for mobilise electoral support the party can adopt a different approach if it have an alternative economic or social vision but generate an alternative vision will require it to change it fundamental character it organise principle it be noticeable that far from caution it leader against the use of vitriol during the delhi campaign the bjp’s top leader extend full support to them through their eloquent silence now after the party’s resound defeat a line of argument propagate in bjp circle be that the delhi voter neglect grave issue of religion and nationalism for the sake of freebie it be the tension between this inability of the bjp to change and the grow urge and energy for change at the grind level among the voter that will constitute the political and social dynamic of india in the next few year the author teach history at jawaharlal nehru university
-1	advertisement america harsh anti immigration policy under the trump administration be hardly a good example for the rest of the world but leave it to the supporter of indian prime minister narendra modi to distort a well intentioned american law for nefarious end they have dust off something call the lautenberg amendment an obscure cold war era law to justify prime minister narendra modi anti muslim citizenship amendment act caa modi law have spark massive protest in india and condemnation around the world but his supporter claim there be no functional difference between america lautenberg and india caa a recent piece in news18 cnn indian news site dismiss the west reaction to the caa a ill inform because it ignore the similarity to the u s lautenberg amendment likewise the haf the hindu american foundation a u.s. base outfit dedicate to fight hinduphobia advise u s critic to read the lautenberg amendment before criticize the caa meanwhile modi supporter in the indian american community be petition the seattle city council to reject the severely misguide misinform anti caa resolution float by one of it member because caa be india lautenberg but this be pure posture mean to confuse the world it be true that america pas lautenberg name after the democratic jewish senator from new jersey who sponsor it in 1990 to hand jews and christians in the soviet union and some southeast asian country — vietnam cambodia laos — an expedite pathway to gain refugee status in america typically prospective refugee have to individually prove they be face persecution to gain admission and they have to flee to another country and apply through international organization like the united nations but lautenberg create a presumption of persecution for jews and christians because of concern that the political turmoil generate by the collapse of the soviet union might make them even more vulnerable to persecution than usual so they have to show merely a generalize — not individualize — fear to be consider for admission also sometimes they could apply directly from their home country without flee first when lautenberg be pas international refugee assistance project betsy fisher tell the week it create additional pathway to expand america relatively generous refugee program at the time before the current administration gutted it what do the caa do it fast track citizenship for hindus christians buddhists sikhs jains and parsees from pakistan afghanistan and bangladesh who arrive in india before december 2014 — but leave out persecute muslims such a the ahmaidyas from pakistan or the rohingya from myanmar in other word it impose a religious test for citizenship caa supporter argue this be functionally similar to lautenberg because just like lautenberg the caa create special channel for some group without eliminate exist channel for any group muslims who be leave out of the caa can still access normal channel for admission just like refugee not cover by lautenberg can apply through usual channel but this analysis strain the truth at every level for starter unlike the caa lautenberg be a flexible ongoing program not a one time deal its underlie purpose be to create a mechanism to rescue the most vulnerable religious group in the world at any give time hence the law have to be reauthorized every year at which point lawmaker have the option of revise the list of group need help in 2004 lautenberg be extend to iran — and not just the jews and christians in the country but also the baha be a religious sect that be consider heretical by iran mullah in other word lautenberg cut against dominant prejudice while the caa cater to them moreover lautenberg laudably aim to admit more refugee into america not create a discriminatory citizenship standard for those inside the country when it come to u s citizenship one uniform standard apply to everyone regardless of race caste creed religion or nationality but the big lie that caa supporter tell be that refugee not fast track by the law can still avail normal channel just like lautenberg lautenberg relax standard for some refugee to admit more in the caa admit not a single extra refugee furthermore once admit refugee in america have a pretty straightforward path to citizenship but india exist refugee and citizenship channel be a sick joke unlike much of the world india have studiously refuse to sign the united nations convention on refugee or other similar protocol so it be under no obligation under international law to extend even minimal care or assistance to those flee to it shore moreover note ipsita chakravarty of scroll in one of the few unafraid and honest publication leave in india in the modi era india have no dedicate law that guarantee basic due process right to refugee it rely instead on a thicket of other law and vague operate procedure to determine who have a "well found fear of persecution this basically leave refugee to the tender mercy of bureaucrat the upshot unsurprisingly be that those group the caa target for favoritism already get good treatment than the others from the indian system even before the caa note chakravarty hindus flee pakistan and bangladesh be able to obtain drive license bank account and pan card the equivalent of social security card they even get access to education and health care facility and can buy small dwell unit for self occupation and self employment." this be not a lot but it be a lot more than what the rohingya or the ahmadiyas get these group have be herd into filthy camp and can t even obtain sim card for cell phone more shockingly two year ago when ten of thousand of rohingyas be desperately try to escape myanmar because of the unspeakable brutality of the security force modi declare the rohingya refugee in india a terror threat and want to deport them back to their country to be slaughter indeed thousand of rohingyas live in just five indian city but only 500 have be grant long term visa in other word refer these folk to normal channel mean consign them to either a sub human existence in camp or certain death back home but the big lie that caa supporter peddle be that the law win t leave these group any bad off what the law proponent conveniently don t acknowledge be that the caa be only one arm of modi pincer to disenfranchise muslims on india soil the other be the national registry of citizenship this registry which modi muslim bait home minister have declare will be implement nationwide by 2024 would require india 1.3 billion individual to prove to the government that they be citizen every man woman and child in india will have to arrange paper show for example that they have ancestor go back to a specify cutoff date along with other requirement this be a near impossible task for india poor and illiterate especially give the notoriously bad record keep at the municipal level –— and the modi government know this indeed if the pilot program in the province of assam be any indication the upshot of this exercise will be that hundred of million of indians of all faith will be unable to come up with the proper paperwork to make the cut the whole point of the caa be to hand hindus and other select group who don t make it on the nrc a way out while strip citizenship right from an untold number of india 140 million muslims not just recent refugee but also those with tie go back generation the modi government be reportedly build detention camp all over the country for those exclude from the nrc this be the opposite of lautenberg — both in letter and spirit to be sure lautenberg have never fully live up to it promise like the rest of the refugee program it become hostage to compete special interest and the foreign policy whim of the sit administration and shamefully phony national security consideration have prevent the law from be extend to group like the iraqi yazidis who be face genocide by isis india have invoke bad american immigration law for it nativist end in the past for example a 2005 indian supreme court rule actually quote from the u s supreme court notorious and largely discard 1889 chinese exclusion decision to declare that the high duty of a nation be to give security against foreign aggression and encroachment include from vast horde of foreigner crowd in upon u but turn a well intentioned american law on it head to justify the modi government sinister design be obscene the world should see this insidious comparison by modi cheerleader for the disinformation campaign

asia ex japan model portfolio we be currently overweight india it may appear surprise in the context of the continue economic slowdown in india but stock selection be relatively easy in india there be a pretty wide universe of company which generate excess return routinely that mean return on equity be high than cost of equity and these company be strew across a wide range of sector like consumer discretionaries consumer staple private sector bank even it company have be stag recovery of late in other word foreign investor have a much wide canvas to choose from which be reaffirm in the trend that we see in term of foreign flow whenever it recover in emerging markets india be one of the key beneficiary we have see a liquidity drive rally earnings growth estimate for fy20 keep on drift down over the year and a a consequence valuation for india have actually move up a the market rally that say i must also point out that there be a wide divergence in valuation across different class of stock everyone look at the top tier high quality stock they be expensive at this point of time but the foreign institutional investor be still attract to them not just because of their high quality but also the relative stability in their earn estimate and the liquidity that they offer if one go down the top tier stock to the midcap and small cap stock there be a degree of divergence even within those class the relatively high quality midcap stock be way more expensive than the second and third tier one we think that while the market may appear expensive when one look at headline valuation it do offer stock pick opportunity and it would be possible to outperform the broad market with careful stock selection i would hesitate to paint a broad brush picture say that okay it would be a year of midcaps because within the midcap universe or even within the smallcap universe there be a divergence in term of quality and valuation one would have to be selective in term of stock it really would be a stock pickers’ market there be a few macroeconomic factor that need to fall in place currently earn growth in india be be predominantly lead by financials particularly the private sector bank and insurance and a few company in the consumer staple and consumer proxy area we need to see a bite of divergence and broadbasing of that universe before we see a sustain earn estimate recovery one would have to see some degree of recovery in the industrial space which would happen once we begin to see a sustainable recovery in capacity utilisation which would in turn be trigger by a demand recovery now obviously these be difficult to achieve in the near term and i do not think there be any magic bullet that be available either for the government or for the central bank i would think that one would have to wait for maybe the second half of fy21 to see some of these variable fall in place if i look back at the key economic component private consumption and investment in government consumption the first attempt on the part of policymakers should be to improve private consumption or in other word consumption demand and that in turn can lead to private investment improve at a late date it would mean some degree of fiscal support which unfortunately the government do not have at this point of time so a more sustainable economic recovery from pure base effect it would take another two to three quarter at least so we come back to that same old equation that we can expect to see some degree of stabilisation in the second half of fy2021 the sector which have possibly spawn the most compounders in india be consumer staple consumer discretionaries private sector bank and it service these be the four sector where you find most of them our way to identify them be simply to look at excess return generation or in other word the company that generate a return on equity high than cost of equity on a sustain basis over 15 to 20 year or so the majority of these excess return generator fall into these sector that i mention just now indian company historically have be very careful one could even use the word stingy about raise capital and invest because india be a capital starve economy historically and that be why indian company routinely generate high roe and roce than rest of the emerge market that be the characteristic which have stand the indian market in good stead and also engender fii interest on a sustain basis the wish list would be basically that i be not really look at an absolute number when it come to fiscal deficit i would rather be concern about what go inside the fiscal deficit or fiscal spend i would look carefully at whether the measure be design to support or invigorate private consumption i would try to look at some of the structural way of resource raise structural in sustainable way if one get a credible impression of the government try to raise resource from either divestments or asset sale that would clearly be a positive one would also look for credible assumption on tax revenue growth or broad gdp growth in a nutshell it be not just the headline number that we would look at we would try to see what be the assumption that have give rise to those headline number in our conversation with our foreign investor most of the question be actually centre around the economy corporate earn to be more specific what be the implication of the measure that the government or the central bank can take on these in a nutshell foreign investor at this point of time be more concern about the specific number concern the broad macroeconomy and corporate earn than about other variable that the domestic indian investor base or the market watcher may be concern about
