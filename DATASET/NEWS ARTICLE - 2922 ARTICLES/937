Police forces in the area were asked to reach Jamia late Sunday night, after reports of a shooting near the site of the anti-CAA protests. While the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) claimed a shot had been fired, Additional DCP Kumar Gyanesh said police are filing an FIR based on the complaint. “Investigation is on,” Gyanesh said.

The message asking Station House Officers (SHOs) and their staff in the South East district to reach Jamia was flashed from the control room on behalf of the DCP at 12.20 am.

The alleged shooting comes a day after two shots were fired at the anti-CAA protest site at Shaheen Bagh, and three days after firing outside Jamia. While no injuries were reported in Shaheen Bagh, a Jamia student was injured Thursday.

According to the JCC, the latest incident involving two unidentified persons was reported from outside gate number 5 of Jamia Millia Islamia. A statement by the committee claimed that one of them was wearing a red jacket, and they were on a red scooter. No one was injured, the statement said.
