Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Sunday sought a report from the state government for filing a petition in the Supreme Court against the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the state without informing him.

Khan, who has been at loggerheads with the Left Front government in the state ever since it passed a resolution in the state Assembly against the CAA, made it clear he would not remain a ‚Äúmute spectator‚Äù and would ensure the law of the land is upheld. ‚ÄúThe Constitution has to be upheld and this is not a personal fight,‚Äù Khan was quoted as saying by PTI.

Last week, the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had filed a petition under Article 131 and sought the law to be declared unconstitutional and in violation of Article 14 (Equality before law), 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty) and 25 (Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice, and propagation of religion) of the Constitution.
