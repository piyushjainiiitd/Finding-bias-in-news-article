Amid complaints against Shaheen Bagh protesters for blocking the road and causing inconvenience, the protesters Tuesday decided to allow school vans to pass through the stretch.

Sharing a video that shows a school van passing through the barricades, the Twitter handle of Shaheen Bagh protesters read: “Dear @DelhiPolice, we too have children of our own, and understand parents’ worries for their children’s schooling and futures. Many of our children are still recovering from unfair injuries sustained at JMI. Keeping schools in mind, we are allowing school vans to cross.”

The plea in the Supreme Court, filed by advocate Amit Sahni, urged the SC to direct the monitoring of the situation by a retired judge of SC or sitting judge of Delhi HC “in order to avoid any further deterioration of the situation and to circumvent any violence”, and issue any other directions as may be required.

The protest has inspired a similar demonstration at a park in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj, East Delhi’s Khureji Khas as well as Lucknow’s Ghantaghar.
