The Constitution Protection Committee, comprising Left parties and their affiliated bodies, on Thursday, took oath to protect the Indian Constitution that gives equal rights to all citizens irrespective of their caste, creed and religious faiths, on the 123rd birth anniversary of freedom fighter and founder of the Indian National Army Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

After garlanding the statue of Netaji at Subhashnagar, CPI (ML) - New Democracy leader V.
