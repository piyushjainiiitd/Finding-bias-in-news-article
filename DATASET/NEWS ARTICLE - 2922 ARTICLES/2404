New Delhi: A section of protesters at Shaheen Bagh on Saturday said they are willing to speak to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and discuss their concerns regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The agitators, mostly women, have been demonstrating at the locality in southeast Delhi since mid-December.

The comments come a day after Shah said anyone who wants to discuss issues related to the CAA with him can seek time from his office. "(We) will give time within three days," he had said at a programme in the national capital on Thursday.

"We accept Amit Shah's proposal for a discussion. We are ready to meet at 2pm tomorrow. We are not seeking any appointment," said the protesters on Saturday. "Now it's for Home Minister Amit Shah to decide whether to meet us (and where) or not."

But sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs said no such meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.

Syed Ahmed Taseer, one of the organisers of the protest, said the onus is on the government to call them for talks. The protest is "leaderless" and it is up to Shah to decide who all he wanted to call for talks, he added.

Mehrunnisa, who has been a regular at the protest, said the protesters would march to Shah's residence on Sunday.

"We would ask him to withdraw CAA-NRC-NPR," she said, adding the protest will continue till their demand is met.

Shah on Thursday Strongly had defended the CAA, which provides for Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, and said there is no such provision in the new law that will take away the citizenship of Muslims.
