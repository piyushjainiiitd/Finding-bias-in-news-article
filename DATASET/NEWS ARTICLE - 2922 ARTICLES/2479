Stick to approved text: CMO to governor Arif

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In yet another round of confrontation, Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan is learnt to have conveyed to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan that paragraph 18 of the governor’s address, to be delivered in the state assembly on Wednesday at the beginning of the Budget session, doesn’t have his approval.The paragraph deals with the passage of an assembly resolution against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act and mentions the stand of the Kerala government that the Act is “anti-constitutional and discriminatory”.Sources in the LDF government confirmed that Raj Bhavan wrote to the CMO on Tuesday evening, rejecting the clarification submitted by Pinarayi’s office on concerns raised by the governor regarding the inclusion of the CAA in the draft address prepared by the council of ministers.On Monday, in response to a clarification sought on January 25, the CMO informed Raj Bhavan that the draft speech approved by the cabinet should be delivered by the governor “without any change”. Quoting the Supreme Court verdict in the Union of India vs Basavaiah Chaudhary in 1979, the governor said in his letter that he was bound by the advice of the council of ministers to acquaint members of the assembly with the policies and programmes of the government.Neither the SC verdict nor Article 176 (1) of the Constitution says that the governor is bound to express the views of the government on extraneous subjects, the letter pointed out. According to the governor, by including CAA in the address, the council of ministers had tried to mix ‘view’ with ‘policies’ and ‘programmes’ of the government. It is learnt that the state cabinet decided to ignore the concerns raised by the governor at the last moment and go ahead with the original speech approved by the cabinet last week.
