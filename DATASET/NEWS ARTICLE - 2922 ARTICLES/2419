CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar in Patna

PATNA: Former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Wednesday said anti-CAA activist Sharjeel Imam was intentionally being discussed to divert people’s attention from important issues in Delhi election. However, Kanhaiya clarified that he had ideological differences with Sharjeel and would not support anyone giving provocative speech.Kanhaiya was talking to media at Gandhi Maidan before leaving for Bhitiharwa from where he will start his ‘Hamara Desh Hamara Samvidhan, Bapu Dham se Gandhi Maidan’ yatra on January 30. The yatra will conclude at Gandhi Maidan on February 29 with ‘Samvidhan Bachao Nagrikta Bachao’ rally. The yatra is being organized under the banner of NPR-NRC-CAA Virodhi Morcha.When asked about Sharjeel, who is also a JNU student and facing sedition charge, Kanhaiya replied, “I am a law-abiding person and have faith in police investigation. I had also been called a traitor earlier.”Talking about the yatra, Kanhaiya appealed to people of the state to join in large numbers. “We are not against giving nationality to anyone; rather we believe in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and whoever expresses faith in our Constitution should be given citizenship. In fact, the Citizenship Act was made in 2003 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, but this government passed another Act after 14 lakh out of 19 lakh people could not prove their nationality in Assam,” he said.Kanhaiya further said there were chances of mistakes from the officials in collecting and jotting down the data in the process of updating the National Population Register (NPR), and poor will face the brunt. Those who will leave the column blank will be put in the category of doubtful citizen, he claimed.He further said if chief minister Nitish Kumar was against the present form of NPR, he should pass a resolution against CAA in the assembly.Kanhaiya was accompanied by Kadwa MLA and Congress national general secretary Shakeel Ahmad Khan and social activist Nivedita Jha.
