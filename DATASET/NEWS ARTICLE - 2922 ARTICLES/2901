"In Australia we have seen unfold the inhuman situation at the Manus Island detention center. Multiplied a thousand-fold, is what is on offer with the NRC and CAA. In both countries we have failing strongmen, Modi (economy) and Morrison (climate change). Here a billion animals have died. There, in India, a billion human beings are to be placed on trial. There have to be sought better ways to solve a nation’s problems, and a majority community’s ambitions, other than this bureaucratic and humanistic nightmare," Dr. Arjun Raina, a Melbourne-based independent artist said.

"From Australia, I watch the news in my home country, the USA. Trump demonises immigrants, rounds up refugees, and has made moves to strip Americans of their citizenship. It’s fascism 101, and like the US, India is not immune,"Dr. Ian Woolford, a Melbourne-based academic said.

Dr Vikrant Kishore, another organiser said, “I am deeply disturbed by the violent suppression and police brutality in Jamia Millia Islamia on 15 December 2019, followed by suppression of the student protesters at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and elsewhere. The protest has spread all over India, with very high-handed responses from the Indian government, including cutting off phone and internet in some areas."
