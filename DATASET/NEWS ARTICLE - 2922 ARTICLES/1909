NEW DELHI: BJP leader Giriraj Singh on Thursday stoked a controversy when he alleged that the anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh is making "suicide bombers"."The Shaheen Bagh is no longer a movement, it has become a breeding ground for suicide bombers. A conspiracy is being hatched against the country in its capital," Singh tweeted along with a video of woman protesters presumably from one of the cites of anti-CAA protests . In the video, a woman can be heard urging the protesters present at the venue to seek inspiration from the martyrdom of Imam Hussain in the Battle of Karbala.The ongoing anti-CAA protests have been targetted by the senior BJP leader in the past as well.On Monday, Singh accused AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi of "poisoning" educational institutes like Jamia Millia and Aligarh Muslim University against the country and alleged that Pakistan was created for people like him."Extremists like Owaisi are raising an army of traitors by poisoning institutes like Jamia and AMU against the country. Owaisi and other anti-Constitution people like him must be stopped. Indians have now woken up. Don't suppress and break us. Pakistan was created for you. Let us live in peace," Singh said in a tweet.A day later, he said that the anti-CAA protesters are indulging in a "Khilafat Andolan"."From Shaheen Bagh, the slogans of cheers to Afzal Guru and Yakub Menon were heard. Even Sharjeel Imam had said that he will cut Assam and have an Islamic state in India," he said."In the Parliament, the brother of Asaduddin Owaisi said that if for 15 minutes the police disappear then I will teach a lesson to the Hindus. This is Khilafat Andolan and not protest against CAA," he added.
