VERDICT

A video showing a group of burqa-clad, Muslim women dancing is being circulated widely on social media platforms and WhatsApp, with a claim that the video was shot during an 'entertaining programme' at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh protest site. Many people have been protesting at Shaheen Bagh for over 50 days now against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).A Facebook user who goes by the name of ' Thakur Sunil Singh posted the video with a caption in Hindi that closely translates to, "The 'entertaining programme' arranged at Shaheen Bagh, at night." A Bhojpuri song that praises PM Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been superimposed on the video.The video has been viewed over 1,39,000 times and the post has been shared more than 4,700 times.The same video is being circulated widely on WhatsApp as well, along with the same claim.The video has nothing to do with Shaheen Bagh protest site or the protest going on there.We could trace back the video to 2014. Since then, the video has gone viral many times over the years.A simple search on Google using the keywords 'women hijab dance' on YouTube led us to the exact same video uploaded to a channel that goes by the name 'Prince Prince' on May 17, 2015.While the video that is being shared with the false claim is a 1.38-minute version, the YouTube video above is 2.54-minute long. The song in the original video is not the Bhojpuri song that could be heard in the version that is being shared with the false claim.Using InVid Google Chrome extension, we then extracted key frames of the video the Facebook user shared and ran reverse-image searches on them.One such search led us to an article published on an Arabic website -- nablustv.net -- on November 23, 2014. We translated the page using Google Translate and found the title of the article as 'Video...Professional veiled dancing on Nancy Ajram's song raises controversy'. The page has a screenshot from the video, but the exact location is not mentioned in the article.Times Fact Check has found that a video we could trace back to 2014 is now being shared with a claim that it was shot at Shaheen Bagh protest site.
