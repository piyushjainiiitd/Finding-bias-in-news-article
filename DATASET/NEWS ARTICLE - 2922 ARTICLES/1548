According to images posted by news agency ANI in a tweet, the posters read: “Bangladeshis leave the country, otherwise, you will be driven out in MNS style”. The posters also feature pictures of MNS chief Raj Thackeray and his son Amit Thackeray, who was recently inducted into the party.

This comes days after MNS declared its support to the Narendra Modi government over the eviction of Bangladeshi and Pakistani “infiltrators”.

On January 23, while unveiling his party’s new flag, Raj Thackeray had defended the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC).

He had also announced that the MNS would stage a protest march on February 9 seeking eviction of illegal migrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh.

The MNS was set up in 2006 after Raj Thackeray split from the Shiv Sena.
