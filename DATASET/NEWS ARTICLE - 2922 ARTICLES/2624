KOLKATA: A scuffle broke out between anti-citizenship law protesters and BJP supporters at the Kolkata book fair on Saturday after a senior functionary from the saffron party visited a stall there.The two sides exchanged blows after West Bengal BJP member Rahul Sinha entered the stall early in the evening. A group of Left-backed students surrounded Sinha when he visited the counter, and raised slogans against the CAA and NRC. Police confirmed the incident and said a number of protesters were detained. BJP supporters claimed one of them suffered injuries in the tussle.The clashes apart, the CAA-NRC episode has had a positive effect as well, with books themed on the topic selling like hot cakes at the fair and in stores. Niche publications that print books on current affairs and little magazines that usually struggle to survive are making the most of the spike in interest about the CAA, NRC and NPR , fuelled by the ongoing nationwide protests.Nearly all the publications have come out with is sues focusing on these topics in December and January and these are flying off the shelves at the fair and at stores across Bengal’s capital.Almost all these books are paperbacks and priced between Rs 15 and Rs 50. An obvious example is ‘The Saga of Assam ’s National Register of Citizens (NRC)’, a book that had been gathering dust on a shelf at Parchment Books in Kalighat for months, but saw all its five copies getting sold within 48 hours of the passage of CAA.The seller called the publisher to order more, only to learn that no more copies were available. The scenes are similar at various other book stores across the city.Bookstore owners said that besides their regular customers, mostly students and researchers are buying these books.
