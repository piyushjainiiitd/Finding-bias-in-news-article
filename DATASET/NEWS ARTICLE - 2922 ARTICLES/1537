New Delhi: The Uttar Pradesh Congress under its general secretary in-charge Priyanka Gandhi is actively standing with those protesting against CAA and NRC, especially the minority community.The party is trying to pose a direct challenge to Samajwadi Party (SP) which has till now enjoyed the support of 19% minority of the state. This has led to a strong competition on the ground between the two parties for the 2022 assembly elections.

He is active only on social media,” Shahnawz Alam , chairman, minority department, UP Congress told ET.Meanwhile, SP is questioning Congress intent. “We are fighting with BJP and Congress is trying to become the number two party in the state,” said Udayveer Singh, SP MLC “Because of Congress politics and policies, BJP has got space and isaining ground.”
