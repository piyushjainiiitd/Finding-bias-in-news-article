CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth on Wednesday said the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is not against Muslims. If any Muslim is affected he will lead the protests, he said."CAA is not against Muslims. Muslims will not be affected. If it affects them, I will come out and lead the protests," Rajinikanth told reporters outside his Poes Garden residence in Chennai."Muslims cannot be sent away. Those Muslims, who wanted to go to Pakistan during partition, had left. Those, who believed this is their motherland, stayed back," Rajinikanth said. There is an attempt by some to create confusion, he added."Some political parties are misleading people about CAA. Students should not allow themselves to be misguided by parties. They should fully understand an issue, before jumping into protests," he said.Rajinikanth said NPR is "essential" to check the presence of foreigners.
