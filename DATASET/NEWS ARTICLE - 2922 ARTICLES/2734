NEW DELHI: Pitching for his development agenda for the city – even as BJP tries to corner him on the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh – chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told TOI in an exclusive interview on Wednesday that “21st-century India will not be built by CAA and NRC but by having better schools, colleges and hospitals”.He accused Union home minister Amit Shah of letting the Shaheen Bagh blockade of a critical road fester for one-and-a-half months only for electoral gains. “He is India’s home minister and the most powerful man in the country. Nobody is going to believe that Amit Shah cannot get a road opened,” he said. The CM said BJP had no explanation for its non-performance in corporations and had failed to counter the work done by his government despite many attempts. So, finally, it had to attempt a Hindu-Muslim polarisation.Kejriwal said he stayed away from Shaheen Bagh, Jamia and JNU because these are law-and-order issues and he had a different responsibility. It was up to Amit Shah to tackle it. But he blamed the Centre for the situation in universities, saying party politics should be kept away from university campuses.Such politics was making parents insecure about their children, he said. Claiming that he had cordial relations with lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, Kejriwal said earlier he had been pushed into a confrontation with the Centre against his wishes. When the newly elected Delhi government felt it was unable to do anything, it made them restless. But the SC judgment clarifying the separation of powers restored peace.Asked about Nirbhaya’s parents blaming him for the delay in hanging of the convicts, Kejriwal said they were simple folk and were being misled. He said the AAP government had no role to play in the entire process since the police were not under the city government.
