With only four days left before Delhi goes to polls, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party released its manifesto Tuesday, promising to introduce a ‚Äòdeshbhakti curriculum‚Äô in schools to inculcate the values of nationalism and respect for the armed forces among children.

At a press conference, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said, ‚ÄúAAP wants every Delhi resident to lead a dignified life. And we have taken steps towards achieving that in the last five years.‚Äù

On the ‚Äòdeshbhakti curriculum‚Äô, Sisodia said that it would be in line with other special curriculum introduced by the AAP government like happiness and entrepreneurship programs.

Another highlight of the 28-point manifesto is that it promises to provide a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the family of the sanitation worker if he dies at work.

The manifesto also promised to implement the Jan Lokpal Bill, which has been pending for the last four years waiting for the Centre‚Äôs nod.

The AAP also pushed its longstanding demand of full statehood for Delhi, with Sisodia saying the party will continue its fight for the cause.

The manifesto, however, did not mention to bring any resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The Congress had in its manifesto promised to pass a resolution in the Delhi Assembly, demanding the Centre to drop the CAA brought by the BJP.

Meanwhile, taking a dig at the BJP, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, ‚ÄúBoth BJP and AAP manifestos are here. Now what is needed is a debate on the promises. I want the BJP to declare its CM candidate and I am ready for a debate. The people want to know the CM face of Delhi.

‚ÄúAmit Shah can‚Äôt decide who the CM will be, the people have the right to elect their own CM. I am giving them time till 1 pm tomorrow. If they don‚Äôt, we will hold another press conference tomorrow.‚Äù
