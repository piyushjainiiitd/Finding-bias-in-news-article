The Congress government in Rajasthan has decided to introduce a resolution against the implementation of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Budget session of the Assembly beginning on January 24.

The session will commence with the customary address of Governor Kalraj Mishra. Official sources said here on Sunday the resolution was likely to be tabled and passed on the first day of the session.

The Kerala and the Punjab Assemblies passed similar resolutions to build pressure on the Union government following the remarks of Home Minister Amit Shah that the Centre would “not go back an inch” on the legislation even if all the Opposition parties came together.

While the Budget is likely to be presented in the second week of February, the Assembly will also ratify the Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill passed by Parliament last month for extending the reservation for the SCs and the STs in the Lok Sabha and the Assemblies by another 10 years.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal said the session was being convened early this year because the reservation for the SCs and the STs would expire on January 25.

The Opposition BJP said the State government’s move to bring the resolution against the CAA would be “strongly opposed”. State party president and MLA Satish Poonia said the Assembly was not empowered to stop the implementation of a law enacted by Parliament.
