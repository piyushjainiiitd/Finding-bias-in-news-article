Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said people staging protest against Citizenship Amendment Act are enemies of India. He said those who speak the language of Pakistan are creating disorder by protesting everywhere. While addressing a poll rally in Delhi's Narela area, the chief minister said, "Enemies of India, who speak the language of Pakistan are creating disorder by protesting everywhere. Protests against CAA & a Pakistani minister releasing a statement in favour of Kejriwal, it all looks linked." Adityanath will hold several poll rallies in the national capital.
