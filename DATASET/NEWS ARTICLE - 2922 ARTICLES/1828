Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad arrived in Delhi on Monday morning after he was “forcibly sent” to the airport by the police in Hyderabad, where he was detained ahead of a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. He also claimed that his supporters were thrashed by cops before he was detained on Sunday.

In a tweet in Hindi, Azad wrote, “Dictatorship is at its peak in Telangana. Peoples’ right to protest is being snatched. First, we were thrashed with sticks, then I was arrested and now I have been brought to the airport and being sent back to Delhi.” In the tweet, he also tagged the office of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and said ” Bahujan society will never forget this insult. Will be back soon.” Read in Malayalam

Talking to indianexpress.com, Md Rasheed, Bhim Army coordinator in Telangana, said, “Azad was taken to the airport by police and sent back to Delhi on a 7 am flight.” Aazad is unwell and will be taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, his aides said. If he’s okay, the Dalit leader will go to Karnataka on Tuesday to address two rallies in Gulbarga and Bidar, news agency PTI reported.

Azad was in the city to address an anti-CAA rally organised by All India India Dalit-Muslim-Adivasi Progressive Front. Lungerhouse police said the protesters did not have permission for the agitation and Azad was taken into preventive detention to prevent him from going ahead with it.

The Bhim Army chief was detained from a flat in Mallepally area and taken to Habeeb Nagar Police station. However, since the public began gathering at the police station, he was shifted to Bolaram Police Station. The party’s national coordinator Khush was also detained.

Azad’s detention comes days after he was released from Tihar prison in Delhi following his arrest for allegedly inciting people during an anti-CAA protest.
