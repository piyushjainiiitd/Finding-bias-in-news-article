Over 70 organisations have joined hands for the pakka morcha at Sirhindi Gate, said Nadim Anwar Khan, convenor of the joint action committee of the morcha. ‚ÄúNo doubt Punjab has passed a resolution against the CAA in Vidhan Sabha, but we will continue protesting against it till the Centre does not recall it,‚Äù Khan said.
