New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a rally in Bodo-dominated Kokrajhar town of Assam on 7 February.

This will be the Prime Minister's first visit to the North East since it witnessed several anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in which three people were killed.

Modi will visit Assam on 7 February and address a rally in Kokrajhar, a government official said.

The visit comes a week after the central government signed a peace pact with several Bodo militant groups and a student body.

The signing of the Bodo agreement led to surrender of over 1,500 militants of the major insurgent group National Democratic Front of Boroland.

A summit meeting between Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, scheduled to be held in Guwahati in December, was also cancelled due to the anti-CAA protests.

Modi was also invited for the inauguration of the recently-concluded 'Khelo India' games in Guwahati but he did not attend it.
