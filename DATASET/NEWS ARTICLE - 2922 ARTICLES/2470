NEW DELHI:

Congress on Tuesday fielded senior party leader Kapil Sibal to challenge PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah to a debate with him on all aspects of CAA, NRC and NPR “I challenge the PM and the HM to debate with me, anywhere and anytime of their convenience... I will expose their lies,” Sibal said at a Congress press conference, soon after Shah dared opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi , to debate with him on CAA.“They (Modi and Shah) say CAA is not discriminatory… Be it in the Constitution or the original Citizenship Act, never ever religion has been made a criteria for citizenship in India as CAA has done,” Sibal said. He questioned the HM for saying CAA has nothing to do with NRC and pointed to Shah’s statement in Parliament that after CAA there would be a nation-wide NRC. “The PM said there has been no discussion on NRC but the President’s address to the joint sitting of Parliament in June 2019 did talk about NRC,” he added.
