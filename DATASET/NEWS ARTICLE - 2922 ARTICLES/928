We got involved in the state government to keep the BJP away. Many of our Muslim brothers have said that BJP is the biggest enemy for them."On Sunday, the Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) government decided to bring out a resolution against the CAA in Maharashtra Assembly.If this happens, then Maharashtra will be the third state to pass a resolution against CAA after Kerala and Punjab.The Act grants citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, who came to India on or before December 31, 2014 after fleeing religious persecution there.
