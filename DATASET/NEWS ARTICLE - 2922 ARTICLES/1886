Delhi Assembly Election 2020 LIVE Updates: Accusing Delhi Chief Minister of shielding the ‘tukde tukde gang’, Union Home Minister Amit Shah Monday asked does the Delhi CM support those who talk of ‘dividing the country’. Addressing a poll rally at Rithala area in Delhi, Shah said Kejriwal immediately tweets whenever he talks about issues pertaining to water, electricity, and CCTVs, but would he tell the people of Delhi if he is in favour of sending ‘tukde tukde gang’ to jail. “Kejriwal ji are you in favor of action against Sharjeel Imam or not? Are you in favor of those at Shaheen Bagh or not? Make it clear to the people of Delhi,” he asked.

Earlier in the day, Kejriwal alleged that the BJP does not want to open the Shaheen Bagh stretch of the Kalindi Kunj road where anti-CAA protests are going on for over a month as the saffron party is doing “dirty politics” over it. He said law and order in the national capital entirely lies with the Centre and “if they are saying that they need permission from me, I am giving them permission, open the road in one hour”. On Amit Shah’s promised to make Delhi a ‘world-class city’, Kejriwal said he hopes the home minister does not backtrack on his words once the elections are over.

Earlier today, BJP president J P Nadda on Monday accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of “supporting those who want to break India” while referring to Umar Khalid and former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar. He also asked Kejriwal “whether acting against anti-nationals would hurt his vote bank”
