A bunch of Shaheen Bagh protesters said that they will meet Union home minister Amit Shah at his residence on February 16 at 2pm to discuss issues related to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). These protesters also said that they have not sought an appointment with the home minister. However, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said, 'No such meeting is scheduled with the Union Home Minister Amit Shah for tomorrow.' The development came two days after Amit Shah said at Times Now Summit 2020 that anyone having doubts over CAA could seek an appointment from his office and he would be willing to meet the person(s) within 3 days.
