A large number of volunteers, cadre of various political parties and some outfits including the Tamil Nadu Towheeth Jamath took out a procession here on Saturday.

Condemning the Centre for the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register and National Register of Citizens, they urged the Tamil Nadu government to pass a resolution in the Legislative Assembly and prevail on the Centre to withdraw them.

Former Congress MP Lakshmanan, DMK MLA Moideen Khan and some from Manithaneya Katchi and the AMMK, who addressed the protesters, said the Centre was determined to create division among the people on religious lines.
