Delhi AAP Government Formation highlights: AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal will take oath as the chief minister of Delhi on February 16 for the third consecutive time at the historic Ramlila Maidan in Delhi.

Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters, senior party leader Manish Sisodia, who was the deputy chief minister in the outgoing government, said all cabinet ministers will also take oath along with Kejriwal at the event.

Kejriwal is also likely to retain all the cabinet ministers who were part of his previous government, reported PTI quoting AAP sources.

Earlier today, Kejriwal also met the Lieutenant Governor. The meeting lasted for around 15 minutes, an official said.

AAP secured a second five-year term by winning 62 of the 70 seats and with a vote share of 53.57 per cent, a marginal drop from 54.34 per cent in 2015. The BJP, a distant second, won the remaining eight seats as against three in the last Assembly polls, and its vote share climbed from 32.2 per cent to 38.51 per cent. Congress drew a blank again, recording its lowest vote share — 4.26 per cent — since the first polls for the Delhi Assembly in 1993.
