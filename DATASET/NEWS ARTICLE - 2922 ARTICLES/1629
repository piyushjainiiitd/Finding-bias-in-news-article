LUCKNOW: A 15-year-old boy spent 42 days in jail in connection with the December 19 anti-CAA violence in Lucknow after police told him “ umar badha ke batao (add years to your actual age)”, forcing him to say he was 18 “out of fear”, his lawyer alleged.The minor’s advocate, Yashab Husain Rizvi, said when he was assembling documents to prepare a reply to a recovery notice served to the minor by the government seeking compensation for damages allegedly caused by him, his Aadhaar card revealed his age as 15 years.Advocate Yashab Husain Rizvi filed a complaint with the Lucknow police commissioner, seeking to know why the teenager had not been tried under the Juvenile Justice Act and was kept in a jail instead of a juvenile home. It also sought that Hazratganj police be tried for “illegal action”.The minor, a resident of Malda district in West Bengal , had 15 charges slapped on him, including attempt to murder and rioting with deadly weapon. He told TOI on Friday,“They took me to the police station and told me ‘umar bada ke batao.’ So, out of fear, I told them I was 18.” “It is not our prerogative to enquire about the person’s age . It is for the court to determine the age ,” said inspector of Hazratganj police station, Dhirendra Kushwaha.
