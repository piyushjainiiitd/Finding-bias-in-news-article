New Delhi: The political gallery may be debating which is the bigger embarrassment — Congress’ listless campaign to repeat its 2015 ‘zero show’ or the national BJP leadership’s war-like mobilisation to manage just eight seats in Delhi — but Congress central leadership is happy that its national rival has retained its losing streak in assembly polls. However, the Delhi verdict reinforces Congress image of being a poor retriever after losing to regional parties in UP, Bihar, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Andhra, West Bengal, and Odisha.Delhi’s practice of making a different choice in Lok Sabha and assembly saw Congress finishing second in 5 of the 7 seats that BJP swept just 9 months ago, pushing AAP to the third position. Congress then had the advantage of the perception that the LS polls were a national fight between the BJP-led NDA and a Congress-led opposition. It polled 22.5% votes against AAP’s 18.1% and BJP’s 56.5%. However, the assembly polls was a battle between incumbent AAP and challenger BJP, and Congress crashed to an all-time low of 4% votes.Leaderless and directionless since Sheila Dikshit ’s defeat in 2013, Delhi Congress ran a halfhearted campaign, knowing well that the anti-BJP voters would rally behind AAP.Delhi Congress initially focused on a dozen seats and fielded seasoned candidates but once BJP unleashed the Modi-Shah-Adityanath-led polarising blitzkrieg — which saw around 250 BJP MPs campaigning for local polls that was made into some kind of a referendum on CAA-NRC and the Shaheen Bagh protest branded as a ‘Muslim gang-up’, while people at a rally were made to chant ‘shoot the traitors’ and sops were distributed through the budget and Ram Janmabhoomi trust — it was evident that a counter rallying would squeeze out Congress. And AICC won’t mind the whispers that the party tactically backed AAP.Congress knows a BJP defeat in Delhi would add to the narrative that BJP has become ‘serial loser’ of key states under Modi regime despite Hindutva and hyper-nationalism planks. Congress calculates the trend would boost the confidence of anti-BJP parties in Bihar, Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu ahead of the UP battle in 2022.Though Congress and larger anti-BJP regional parties would be dismissive of the return of ‘ Kejriwal is Modi’s challenger’ spin, Congress’ real worry would be on the increasing inability of its state units to retrieve states lost to regional parties. This would mean Congress playing supporting role to regional parties — as in Maharashtra and Jharkhand — becoming a larger trend, thus hindering party’s national ambition.
