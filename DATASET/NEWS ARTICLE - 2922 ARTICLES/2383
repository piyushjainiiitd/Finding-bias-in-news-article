Sarah Shahi has been cast in the lead role of the upcoming Netflix dramedy series “Sex/Life,” Variety has learned.

The series is described as the story of a love triangle between a woman, her husband, and her past. Shahi will play Billie Connelly, a woman with everything to lose, a suburban mother of two who goes in search of that sexy, single girl in the city she used to be ten years ago. She takes a fantasy-charged trip down memory lane that sets her very married present on a collision course with her wild-child past.

Shahi’s recent TV credits include Showtime’s “City on a Hill” as well as “The Rookie,” “Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings,” “Reverie,” and “Chicago Fire.” She is also known for her roles on shows like “Person of Interest,” “The L Word,” and “Alias.” She will next be seen in the indie film “Language Arts.”

She is repped by CAA and McKeon Myones Entertainment
