BJP MPs Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma have been served notice by the Election Commission over their inflammatory speeches. BJP MPs Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma have been served notice by the Election Commission over their inflammatory speeches.

The Election Commission (EC) Tuesday sent a showcause notice to BJP MP Anurag Thakur for his “desh ke gaddaro ko” chant at a BJP rally in New Delhi. BJP MP Parvesh Verma who alleged that protesters at Shaheen Bagh “can enter homes and rape our sisters and daughters” is also expected to receive a notice from the EC tomorrow.

“The Commission has received a report from Chief Electoral Office, NCT of Delhi vide his letter dated 28th January 2020 that you have made the following statements after chanting ‘Desh ke gaddaro ko’ and followed by response of the crowd ‘Goli maro saalo ko’ many times, while addressing a public meeting on 27th January 2020…you also made certain other objectionable statement in the meeting,” the EC notice read.

The EC further said it is, prima facie, of the view that Thakur violated provisions of the Model Code of Conduct as his statements have the “potential of disturbing communal harmony and aggravating the existing difference between social and religious communities”.

It has given Thakur time till 12 noon on January 30 to file his reply.

Speaking to The Indian Express on Monday, Thakur said he merely asked people what should be done with traitors of the country. “I just wanted people to say what is to be done with traitors of the country. It could have evoked a response like ‘vote them out’ or ‘throw them out’. But it was the people who reacted so,” he said.

Verma, on the other hand, alleged that anti-CAA protesters at Shanheen Bagh “can enter homes and rape our sisters and daughters”.

“People of Delhi know that the incident that had happened in Kashmir, the daughters and sisters of Kashmiri Pandits were raped. Similar incidents continued to happen in Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad, Kerala. Today, a similar situation has arisen at a place in Delhi (Shaheen Bagh). Lakhs of people gather there. People of Delhi will have to think and make a decision. They can enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters and kill them. There’s time today, Modiji and Amit Shah won’t come to save you tomorrow… People are safe until Narendra Modi is the prime Minister. If someone else takes charge, nobody will feel safe here,” Verma said.

On Monday, Verma had said that no one will be found at the protest site in Shaheen Bagh if BJP is voted to power in Delhi.

Delhi Congress approached the Election Commission, urging it to ban Thakur and Verma for making “provocative statements to incite communal violence” ahead of polls in the national capital.

“BJP’s star campaigners Parvesh Verma and Anurag Thakur have used objectionable language. Top BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, are going around the lanes and bylanes of Delhi, making provocative statements to polarise the atmosphere and incite communal violence. The BJP is doing so out of frustration,” senior Congress leader Ajay Maken said.

Earlier, BJP’s Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra was banned from campaigning for 48 hours by the EC over a tweet in which he had called the February 8 polls a contest between India and Pakistan.
