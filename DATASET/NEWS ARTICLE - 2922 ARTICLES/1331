The basketball mover and shaker known as “World Wide Wes’’ apparently won’t join the Knicks after all.

Reports last week said William Wesley would be joining incoming president Leon Rose in the team’s front office. Tuesday night, however, The Athletic reported Wesley will not join the Knicks in any official capacity.

Wesley has been a longtime business partner of Rose and a longtime fixture as confidant to current Kentucky coach John Calipari, who is on record saying he won’t coach the Knicks but would help Rose as “a resource.’’

Wesley has a slew of business ventures in the basketball industry, likely making any formal role with the Knicks not ideal. League insiders, however, believe Wesley probably can help Rose behind the scenes, even as the NBA’s tampering rules have been more strictly enforced.

According to an NBA source familiar with the situation, there was never a verbal agreement for Wesley to join the Knicks as there is with Rose.

Rose, meanwhile, is still going through the process of leaving CAA and his many clients.

A source said Rose is expected at the All-Star Weekend festivities in Chicago, but not in an official Knicks role. A formal announcement on Rose is likely to occur after the All-Star break.
