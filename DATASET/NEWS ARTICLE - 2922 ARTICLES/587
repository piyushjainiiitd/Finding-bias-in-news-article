Recently, veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah expressed his views on the on-going anti-CAA-NRC-NPR protests happening in the country. In a conversation with ‘The Wire’, the actor spoke about the current worrying issue, the rise of communalism and why the actors from the film industry haven’t spoken about it.He particularly mentioned Anupam Kher and his views on social media. He said, "I am not on Twitter. These people, the Twitterati, and I really wish they would make up their minds in what they believe in. Someone like Anupam Kher has been very vocal. I don't think, he needs to be taken seriously, he is a clown, any number of his contemporaries from NSD, NFTII can test to his scycophant nature, it is in his blood, he can't help it. The others who are opposing it should really decide about what they want to say and don't remind us of our responsibilities, we known our responsibilities."To this, Anupam too gave it back as he posted a video message for Naseeruddin. He took to his Twitter account and wrote, “जनाब नसीरुदिन शाह साब के लिए मेरा प्यार भरा पैग़ाम!!! वो मुझसे बड़े है। उम्र में भी और तजुर्बे में भी। मै हमेशा से उनकी कला की इज़्ज़त करता आया हूँ और करता रहूँगा। पर कभी कभी कुछ बातों का दो टूक जवाब देना बहुत ज़रूरी होता। ये है मेरा जवाब।“Now, late politician Sushma Swaraj ’s husband, lawyer and former Mizoram governor Swaraj Kaushal has come out in defence of Anupam Kher. In a series of tweets, he wrote that as a contemporary of Anupam, he could confirm that the actor is an ‘honest, upright and a self made man’. Check out his tweets below:He further also added, “You think you are a better actor than Anupam Kher ? You are sadly mistaken. Mr.Naseeruddin Shah, you are an ungrateful man. This country gave you all the name, fame and money. Yet you are a disillusioned man. You married outside your religion. No one ever said a word. Your brother became Lt.General of the Indian Army .”
