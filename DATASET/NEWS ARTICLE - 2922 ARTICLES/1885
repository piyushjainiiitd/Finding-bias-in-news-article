PANAJI: Archbishop of Goa Filipe Neri Ferrao, on behalf of the Catholic community in Goa, released a strongly-worded statement on Saturday appealing to the Centre to “immediately and unconditionally revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act and desist from implementing the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register”.“The very fact that the CAA uses religion goes against the secular fabric of the country,” he said, adding that CAA, NRC and NPR are causing “great concern and anguish” to millions of Indians spread throughout the world.The archbishop further added that the NRC and the NPR exercises would result in “a direct victimisation” of the underprivileged classes, “particularly the Dalits, adivasis, migrant labourers, nomadic communities and the countless undocumented people who, after having been recognised as worthy citizens and voters for more than 70 years in this great nation, will suddenly run the risk of becoming stateless and candidates for detention camps in their teeming millions”.
