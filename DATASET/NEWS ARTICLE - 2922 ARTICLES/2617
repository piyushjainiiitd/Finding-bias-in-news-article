A Congress delegation led by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Monday met officials of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to demand a probe into the alleged allegations of police atrocities against those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across the state of Uttar Pradesh.

The Congress delegation, which also included Mohsina Kidwai, Salman Khurshid, P L Punia, Jitin Prasada, Abhishek Singhvi, Rajiv Shukla and UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, also demanded a thorough probe into the deaths that took place in the state during the violent protests last December.

‚ÄúGiven the role of a reckless state government that views the law and Constitution as mere inconveniences, treats its own citizens like criminals and wears its hostility towards ordinary citizens as a badge of pride, the duty of institution such as the NHRC to act as check and balances and to embody and protect the values enshrined in the Constitution becomes paramount,‚Äù the Congress memorandum to the NHRC said.

The delegation submitted a detailed 31-page representation that included videos and photographs as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of alleged atrocities and human rights violations. After the meeting, Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet, urged the NHRC to act decisively to protect the ‚ÄúConstitutional rights of our citizens‚Äù.

After the meeting, Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi told reporters, ‚ÄúIt has been found that there has been a failure to lodge FIRs. Not a single police officer (has been) named as accused. There have been numerous FIRs against protestors in which victims have become accused‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe showed videos of BJP and RSS people recruited as police mitras who were unleashed on people. Notices were given to people by administration threatening them against joining protests,‚Äù PTI quoted Singhvi as saying.

Uttar Pradesh is the worst-affected state by the protests against the CAA with violence erupting mainly in 12 districts, including Firozabad, Rampur, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Bahraich. At least 20 people have been killed so far‚Äî mostly of bullet injuries from firearms with serious questions being raised concerning the conduct of the UP police and the state administration.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier warned of ‚Äúbadla‚Äù on the protesters and ordered that those found responsible for damaging public property during the protests would have to pay for it.
