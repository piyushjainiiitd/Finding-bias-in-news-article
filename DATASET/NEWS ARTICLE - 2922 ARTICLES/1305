VERDICT

A Twitter handle named @Anti__Modi shared an aerial-view photo of a massive gathering, claiming that Indore High Court lawyers protested against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 and the National Register of Citizenship (NRC).The handle claimed that these advocates promised to fight cases (if any) filed by police against Indore protestors, pro bono.An archived version of the tweet is here. Several other Twitter users shared the same image with more or less similar claims about Indore High Court advocates protesting against CAA/NRC.The photo is of an anti-CAA protest that happened in Bengaluru and has nothing to do with Indore.CNN News18 journalist Revathi Rajeevan had tweeted the same photo on January 21, 2020, with a caption saying, “Protest against NRC, NPR, CAA in Shivajinagar, Bengaluru now”.In another tweet, Rajeevan confirmed that the picture was clicked by her in Bengaluru's Shivaji Nagar.We could not find any credible news report about any anti-CAA protest by advocates in Indore.However, we found a tweet from an Indore-based lawyer Ashhar Warsi, who on January 21, 2020 tweeted a photo of a few lawyers, saying Indore lawyers marched at Badwali Chowki, on January 20, 2020, in solidarity with Shaheen Bagh , Delhi protesters.Times Fact Check has found that a photo of Bengaluru anti-CAA protest is being shared with false claim that it is from Indore where high court advocates protested against CAA, 2019.
