NEW DELHI: Following a fierce election campaign that concluded on Thursday, the stage is all set for a mega showdown in Delhi as the national capital gears up for voting on Saturday.Marked by the BJP aggressively pushing the anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh as a poll issue, the AAP hard selling development and the Congress conspicuous by its near absence, the bitter, often divisive campaign for the Delhi assembly elections ended on Thursday, ahead of the voting on Saturday.With leaders across political spectrum visiting temples for divine blessings, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal eyes another term amid a no-holds-barred fight from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress.Voting for the 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi at over 13,000 polling booths across the city will take place from 8am to 6pm on Saturday, a poll official from the Chief Electoral Office of Delhi said. The counting of votes will take place on February 11.Over 1.47 crore voters are eligible to exercise their franchise in the electoral battle for Delhi, which is largely being seen as a triangular contest among the ruling AAP, a spirited Congress and the opposition BJP which has campaigned very aggressively.Around 40,000 Delhi Police personnel, 190 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and 19,000 Home Guards have been deployed for smooth conduct of election in the national capital, officials said on Thursday.While the Delhi Police personnel have been put on specific election duties, the companies of CAPFs will ensure the security of polling premises and movement of EVMs. In addition, 19,000 Home guards will assist local police in ensuring security for polling booths, the officials said.A day before Delhi polls , Kejriwal and BJP's Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari on Friday paid obeisance at famous temples in the national capital.Kejriwal, the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party, along with his wife Sunita offered prayers at the famous Hanuman Temple at Connaught Place.After his visit to the temple, the chief minister said he prayed for the progress of the people of Delhi."Sought blessings of Hanuman ji at famous Hanuman temple at CP. Bhagwan ji said-'You are doing good work. Continue serving people like this. Leave the outcome to me, all will be fine," Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.Tiwari also visited the famous Chhatarpur and Kalkaji temples and offered prayers."I prayed for the happiness of the people of Delhi and also sought blessings of the goddesses to enable people to cast their vote judiciously," Tiwari said.The percentage of women contesting the Delhi assembly polls will be the highest in the 2020 assembly polls, at over 11 per cent. This is the first time that this percentage has reached the double digits.Out of the total 672 candidates in the fray in these assembly polls, 79 are women -- over 11 per cent of the total contestants. In 2015, 66 of the 673 contestants, or over 9 per cent, were women, but only six of them were elected to the house.At 111, Kalitara Mandal has lost all her teeth but definitely not her appetite for fish and the will to participate in elections as this oldest voter in Delhi is still excited to get her wrinkled finger inked on Saturday. Born in undivided India in 1908, Mandal has seen the subcontinent go through turbulent phases many times, including two partitions, and lived 'twice as a refugee' in India along with her family before finding a home in the national capital.More than 130 centenarian voters are eligible to exercise their franchise in the February 8 election and they will be treated 'as a VIP' on the polling day.Earlier, the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) office had identified 150 centenarian voters but the number was revised after physical verification."A total of 150 voters, aged 100 and above, were initially identified by our officials. Later, physical verification was done but many of the centenarian voters were found to be dead, and some of them had shifted out of Delhi, so the final figure was revised," a senior official of the Delhi CEO office told .After physical verification, the number of centenarian voters was revised to 132 -- 68 men and 64 women.The highest number of centenarians, 21, were found in West Delhi district and the lowest, 7, in New Delhi district, the official said.
