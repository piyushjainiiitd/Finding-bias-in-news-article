An estimated 61.46 per cent voter turnout was recorded in the Delhi elections for 70 Assembly constituencies on Saturday. Counting of votes will take place on February 11.

The turnout, however, is bound to increase as the polling in some areas of the national capital is yet to finish, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said. The turnout, however, was less than the previous Assembly elections, which had recorded 67.08 per cent polling.

There was a rise in the voting percentage after initial sluggishness, especially in morning hours. ‚ÄúThe polling percentage recorded till 5 pm is 54.14 per cent,‚Äù a Delhi CEO official said.

Over 1.47 crore people were eligible to exercise their franchise in the polls that would decide the fate of 672 candidates in 70 Assembly constituencies that are seeing a triangular contest among the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), opposition BJP and the Congress.
