Sit-in stir at Beniabagh park on Thursday in protest against CAA and NRC.

VARANASI: UP Police on Thursday unleashed a “swift crackdown” on anti-CAA protesters in Varanasi’s Beniabagh grounds, barely 2.4km from Dashaswamedh Ghat.Six protesters were arrested from the spot for indulging in brick-batting. Late in the evening, SP-City Dinesh Kumar Singh said all protesters, including women have been identified with help of photographs and video footage. After collecting evidence, 25 persons, including 15 women have been booked on charges of rioting, voluntarily causing hurt, assault and other sections of IPC.Around 10 am, at least 15 women, primarily from the Muslim community gathered inside Beniabagh grounds and launched a dharna against the amended citizenship law. Within minutes, a group of men from a neighbouring Muslim pocket also trooped into the venue. Protesters displayed banners and tricolours apart from photographs of Gandhi and Ambedkar. Later, they held aloft anti-CAA-NPR-NRC placards.Within half-an-hour, a police contingent was commissioned from Chetganj, Chowk and Dashaswamedh police stations. Initially, cops isolated protesters and allowed only those to stay who displayed identity proof. Later, senior officers accompanied with more policemen, PAC and RAF personnel descended at Beniabagh. When police asked protesters to show a permission letter from the administration they said peaceful protests was a fundamental right that didn’t require permission. Soon, they were taken into custody.
