CCTV footage of the Jamia Millia Islamia Universityâ€™s library has been accessed from December 15, 2019 where DelhiPolice can be seen entering the room in the wake of the start of the anti-CAA protests by the students. The police, wearing riot gear, can be clearly seen thrashing and hitting the students who had been sitting there quietly and studying with sticks. Masked men can also be spotted inside the library along with the police. The video footage raises a lot of questions for the Delhi Police as previously the cops have continuously denied any violence used against students inside the University.
