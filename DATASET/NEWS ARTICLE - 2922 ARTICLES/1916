NEW DELHI: Every protest has its foods—foods that become symbols, touch emotions and offer solidarity and succour, forging bonds that go beyond all kinds of divisiveness.When Mahatma Gandhi led the march from Sabarmati to Dandi, he was conscious of using salt as a symbol—one that affected the poorest person and binds Hindus, Muslims and all of humanity alike. The salt tax imposed by the British was hardly new—it had, in fact, been enacted in 1882, almost 50 years before the salt march — but the peaceful civil disobedience movement needed a powerful symbol, and salt it was.We have seen similar symbolism come up in protest after protest globally. About a decade ago, Icelanders dumped potatoes outside their Parliament in Reykjavik to protest about the poor economy, meaning to point out to their government that, 'Iceland has become a potato country.' Or, that their leaders were 'stupid as potatoes', as the Smithsonian magazine quoted a protester as saying.A few years down the line, there were reports of Ukranian protesters throwing noodles at the Russian consulate over the Russian media’s controversial reportage of their issues because in Ukraine and Russia 'to hand noodles over someone’s ears' means to pull someone’s leg. The protesters were literally calling the media a joke!We all know about eggs making a splash, and tomatoes used to protest against anything rotten — films, but also rotten council men in Spain, a tradition now commemorated every year as La Tomatina festival.In Hong Kong , where pro-democracy protests are raging strong, mooncakes with protest messages and 'teargas' gelatos (made with black pepper) have appeared to protest against a government shooting gas canisters at protesters.In India, the anti-CAA-NRC protests are bringing about new cultural expressions of dissent too such as cheeky posters, graffiti, caricatures etc. But more than anything else, it is the way people have been sharing food and using it as a symbol of bonding and solidarity that is a break from India’s chequered tradition of food dividing people along religious and caste lines.In a society where the photo of a beef dish posted by the official Kerala tourism handle can spark a war of words, where rigid caste hierarchies manifest in who you share your food with, where 'unclean' menstruating women are kept out of kitchens, discrimination is being turned upside down through a new emerging culture of inclusiveness around food at protest venues.The protesting Shaheen Bagh women sharing biryani with all those who come to protest, or Punjab farmers and activists cooking kheer and kada prasad as part of a langar to feed protesters of all religions may be the most eye-grabbing visuals going around, but these are hardly exceptions."Everyone who goes to the protests carries some food with them. You feel, khali haath kya jaayen, it is a way to support people in the bitter cold, and to do our little bit,” says Abhilasha Ojha, art curator and writer, who spent New Year’s eve at the Shaheen Bagh protest. She and her husband took makhana, biscuits and Pulse candy to distribute. There are many accounts of young professionals distributing cake and cookies to children, a baker who does brownies for protesters, cab drivers who contribute parantha-subzi or parantha-achar rolls daily to feed the hungry.People sharing food to offer solidarity and support is not confined to one geographical area either. In Mumbai, a restaurant owner who does not wish to be named, attended a protest and found "people passing around pulao, ice cream and tea… I took a crate of water,” he says, adding, "there was a genuine feeling of sharing and caring and everything was being distributed to everyone. It is unlike anything that I have ever seen before,” he says.Abstaining from food, or fasting, may have been frequently employed in the past to make a point and protest, but now sharing food —all kinds, veg and non-veg, humble and rich – without any barriers is a new way in which Indians are showing that they care about their deepest values.
