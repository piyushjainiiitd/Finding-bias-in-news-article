Shaheen Bagh protesters have contested that though they are willing to have a dialogue, the onus is on the government to call them for talks. ‚ÄúWe are ready to meet the Home Minister. But he should make it clear how many people he wants to meet,‚Äù PTI quoted Syed Ahmed Taseer, one of the protesters, as saying.

Mehrunnisa, who has been a regular at the protest, said the protesters would march to the Home Minister‚Äôs residence on Sunday. ‚ÄúWe would ask him to withdraw CAA-NRC-NPR,‚Äù she said, adding that the protest would continue till their demand was met.
