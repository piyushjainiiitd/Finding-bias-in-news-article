Police said the rally was being held without permission, but the saffron party asserted that it has informed the authorities about it, news agency PTI reported.

The new citizenship law has emerged as the latest flashpoint in the state of Bengal, with the TMC opposing the contentious legislation tooth and nail, and the BJP pressing for its implementation.

Earlier this week, Banerjee slammed the BJP for trying to forcibly implement CAA, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) and described them as “black magic”.

“We (TMC) are not a party of Dushasanas like the BJP. They are the offsprings of Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq, and people should unite to save the country from it,” she said during a rally in Bengal.

The chief minister also said that despite her assurances, over 30 people have died in West Bengal due to fear of the proposed country-wide NRC.
