Two separate public inquiries into the police firing in Mangaluru during anti-CAA protests on December 19, resulting the death of two people, have sought a judicial probe into the violence as well as compensation for the victims.

An inquiry conducted by a three-member Peopleâ€™s Tribunal headed by the former Supreme Court judge V Gopal Gowda, at the behest of the Indian Social Institute and the Association for Protection of Civil Liberties, has concluded that a judicial inquiry is needed to ascertain the truth.

A second inquiry, conducted by a group of rights activists, has additionally demanded the suspension of Mangalore police commissioner P S Harsha and police inspector Shantaram Kunder, who was caught on tape asking policemen to ensure that bullets fired by them did not miss those targeted.
