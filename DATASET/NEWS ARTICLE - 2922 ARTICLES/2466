Model Town, part of the Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha constituency, is a largely affluent area. However, it also has a significant population living in slums.

Part of the Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha constituency, the largely affluent area of Model Town saw a triangular contest, with the AAP pitted against the BJP and Congress.

The AAP has renominated Akhilesh Pati Tripathi to fight from the seat. Tripathi had come under scrutiny as he has been the legal radar for rioting and assaulting the police in 2013. He will be up against controversial former AAP MLA Kapil Mishra, who is contesting on a BJP ticket. Sharma, who was ousted from the AAP, faced a 48-hour campaigning ban last week after he compared the elections in Delhi to "India vs Pakistan". The Congress has nominated Akansha Ola, a secretary of the Mahila Congress. The constituency goes to the polls on 8 February and the results will be announced on 11 February.
