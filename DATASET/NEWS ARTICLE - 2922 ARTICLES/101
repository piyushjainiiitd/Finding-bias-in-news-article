As CCTV footage of police hitting students inside the library at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15 went viral on social media, the university authorities Sunday sought to distance itself and clarified that the administration did not release the video. The university, however, confirmed that the video was from the university library but did not comment on its contents.

Jamia Chief Proctor Waseem Ahmad Khan said the footage had been given to various agencies and added that he didn‚Äôt know from where it leaked.

In an official statement, PRO Ahmed Azeem said, ‚ÄúIt has come to our notice that some video with regard to police brutality in Dr Zakir Husain Library of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) is in circulation. This is to clarify that the video has not been released by the university.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Jamia Coordination Committee, which is actually a Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) of students and alumni of JMI, is spearheading the movement against CAA/NRC/NPA outside Gate No 7 of the university on Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar Road. This is to clarify that JCC is not an official body of the university. Any communication from JCC should not be taken as communication from the university,‚Äù he added.

Azeem also added that ‚Äúa number of Twitter accounts, Facebook pages and other users on different social media platforms are using Jamia Millia Islamia‚Äôs name, creating confusion among people‚Äù.

On the video being from Jamia library, he said, ‚ÄúPrima facie the footage seems to be of the MPhil & PhD section of the Old Library. Police are investigating the case.‚Äù

Asked why the university did not comment on the violence in the video, Azeem said, ‚ÄúWe have already spoken about the violence. We have submitted a police complaint on police brutality and moved court for an FIR. We have mentioned it in our report to the MHRD as well. Today, the talk was about the footage, so we clarified that.‚Äù

The Chief Proctor said the footage had been submitted to the Delhi Police, NHRC, MHRD, the internal fact-finding team of the university as well as the Jamia Teachers‚Äô Association. ‚ÄúWe had, however, given it to them with the undertaking that they will not release it anywhere. We don‚Äôt know from where it has been released. There is nothing in the video that we haven‚Äôt already said. We have been saying from day one that police entered without permission, beat students and damaged our property. Still, we will inquire into the matter,‚Äù he said.

Jamia had set up two committees in December last year, around two weeks after the incident, to probe the matter. One committee was supposed to collect evidence and submit it to the other committee, which would prepare a report. Asked about the status of the report, Azeem said, ‚ÄúThe first committee has already submitted all evidences to the second committee. They are now working on it.‚Äù

Jamia Vice-Chancellor Najma Akhtar did not respond to calls and texts by The Indian Express.
