JAIPUR: The Rajasthan assembly passed a resolution on Saturday urging the Centre to repeal the contentious CAA, amid opposition by BJP which accused the Congress government of pursuing appeasement politics. Rajasthan is the third state to pass such a resolution after Punjab and Kerala Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said, “We have urged the Centre to repeal the law as it discriminates against people on religious grounds, which violates the secular principles of our Constitution. This is the first time in the history of the nation that a law has been enacted which discriminates on religious grounds.”The resolution, which was passed by a voice vote, also asked the Centre to withdraw the new questionnaire framed for preparation of the National Population Register (NPR) because providing the additional information “would cause huge inconvenience” to the people.The resolution has incorporated several objections against the National Register of Citizens NRC ) and NPR. It has also urged the Centre to start the nationwide Census only after dropping the new fields of information.
