The heated Delhi assembly election campaign and protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act have combined to create a restive air in the country’s capital. BJP, desperate to wrest Delhi from the Aam Aadmi Party has run a provocative campaign labelling its opponents as anti-nationals. While home minister Amit Shah is leading a typical hardline campaign by foregrounding the CAA, nationalism and AAP’s ambivalence towards the Shaheen Bagh protests, others like UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union minister of state Anurag Thakur and local MP Parvesh Sahib Verma have exceeded limits and made hate speeches.

As if on cue from such speeches, the area around Shaheen Bagh, where protests have now crossed 50 days, has seen three shootings in four days. Delhi Police’s inept handling—cutting a sorry figure during the first shooting incident by an alleged juvenile—appears to have emboldened more fringe elements. The police, already facing flak for failing to stop the attack on teachers and students in JNU or take penal action afterwards, cannot afford to let the situation slide any further.

To prevent a more serious situation from developing heads have to roll but Delhi top cop Amulya Patnaik, who has had a forgettable stint, has been granted an extension. Elections are a time for people to assess the work done by their government over the past five years. Political violence, especially during elections, is dangerous because it sows the seeds of fear in voters, undermines democracy and distracts from real issues. BJP didn’t really try to sharpen its attack on AAP’s developmental claims after making initial efforts. Time will tell whether this was a mistake or not.
