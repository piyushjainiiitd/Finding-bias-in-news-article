NEW DELHI: Throwing their weight behind the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens , over 150 prominent citizens have written to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking action against “forces” resorting to violence in the name of CAA.These citizens want the government to take steps to “protect democratic institutions” and the letter has been endorsed by former judges, civil servants, armed forces officers, academics and doctors. It was submitted to the President after a delegation met him on Friday.“We strongly feel that there is also an external dimension to the disturbances being created. We, therefore, request the government to look into this matter with all seriousness and safeguard the democratic institutions of the country and take stern action against such forces,” they said.The list of signatories includes 72 bureaucrats , including former defence secretary Yogendra Narain , former chief secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Manipur and Puducherry among others. Fifty-six armed forces officers, including former deputy chief of Army Gurmeet Singh, also signed the letter.
