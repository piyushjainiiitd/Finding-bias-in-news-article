After Muzaffarnagar and Aligarh police invoked Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act against anti-CAA protesters for allegedly ‚Äúusing children as shields,‚Äù the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in Firozabad district has now issued a notice to former Samajwadi Party MLA Azim Bhai, asking him to appear before the committee on February 5 along with his wife Yasmeen for allegedly taking their two children to a protest Monday.

The CWC notice came following a police report prepared on the basis of media reports, which stated that children carried placards during protests.

‚ÄúI had sought permission from the district administration to hold a protest at Hussaina Ka Maidan on January 19. The district administration rejected the request letter on the ground that section 144 CrPC was invoked‚Ä¶ last Sunday (January 19), I along with my friend Aftab held a silent protest at the same venue‚Ä¶ Issuing a notice to me for taking my children to the protest site is harassment by district administration. My wife and children were not forced to stage protest‚Ä¶‚Äù Azim said.
