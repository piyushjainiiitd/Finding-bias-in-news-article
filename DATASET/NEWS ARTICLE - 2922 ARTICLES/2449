VERDICT

A video showing a man paying women, some of them holding placards, is being shared with a claim that protesters at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh take money to agitate against the Narendra Modi-led NDA government over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019. Many women who are seen taking money seem to be Muslims. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 's voice could be heard in the background.The video is being shared widely on social media platforms with a caption in Hindi that translates to, "Muslim women while going to protest at Shaheen Bagh." The video, with Gandhi's voice in the background, and Muslim women seen taking money from a man, gives an impression that the Congress Party is paying women at Shaheen Bagh to agitate against CAA, 2019.A Facebook user by the name 'Dhananjay Tiwari' shared the video uploaded by another user by the name 'Sudhir Kumar' to a page that goes by the name 'Dr Sambit Patra Fans Club', with the caption above.The video uploaded by Kumar has been shared over 65,000 times and has garnered over 1.7 million views.Many individual Facebook users and pages have been sharing the same video making similar claims.The video has nothing to do with the anti-CAA protest going on at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh.Some fake-news peddler superimposed one of Rahul Gandhi's speeches on an old video from Manipur , showing some women being paid by a man, to make the false claim that anti-CAA protesters are paid to agitate against the central government, and made it look like the Congress Party is paying these women.Using keyword search on Google, we found the same video uploaded to a YouTube channel named 'Jigar Atha' on October 23, 2017, with the title, 'Congress workers distributing cash for rally'.Investigating further, we found the same video uploaded to a YouTube channel named 'Indian Weapons' on March 2, 2017, with the title, 'Congress Bribing Voters In Imphal, Manipur? VIDEO GOES VIRAL!'Both these videos do not have Gandhi's speech playing in the background.The first frame in these videos show a Muslim woman holding a placard with 'Ward No 5 (KMC)' written on it. Taking cues from the facts that the video is being claimed to be from Manipur, the Manipuri dialect that could be heard, and 'KMC' written on the placard, we ran a few keyword searches on Google to see if we can establish a connection. We learned that KMC could be an abbreviation for Kakching Municipal Council in Manipur, and the video could be from there.On reading about Kakching, we saw that the district is part of of Outer Manipur (Lok Sabha constituency) and has one MLA in the state assembly - Congress's Y Surchandra Singh, who won the 9th assembly election. We then searched when this election was conducted and found that Legislative Assembly election in Manipur was held on March 4 and March 8, 2017. The video, since it is seen to have been first uploaded to YouTube on March 2, 2017, could have been taken during the election campaigns there.We then found the speech given by Gandhi that has been superimposed on the video in question. A simple search on Google using keywords 'Gujarat Rahul Gandhi speech made in Gujarat' led us to the video from where the audio has been lifted and superimposed on the video that is now being widely shared with the false claim.Taking a cue from the above result, we found the original video uploaded to Rahul Gandhi's official YouTube channel, on October 23, 2017.The portion of the audio that has been superimposed on the video in question is from 2.25 to 5.15 minutes.Times Fact Check has found that an old video from Manipur showing a man paying some women, with an audio bit of a speech made by Rahul Gandhi in Gujarat months later superimposed on it, is being shared with a false claim that protesters at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh take money to agitate against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.
