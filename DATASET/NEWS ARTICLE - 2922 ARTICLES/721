NEW DELHI: Its debacle in Delhi may be seen by many as a rebuff to the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), but BJP does not intend to back down from its plan to use the new law as one of its key planks.The BJP leadership believes the focus on CAA was the reason why its. Party officials also said the popularity of CAA or otherwise was not an issue in Delhi because of Arvind Kejriwal’s tactical ambiguity over both the law and the opposition it has drawn. “He skated around it and towards the last stage of the campaign, appeared to blame the Shaheen Bagh disruption on protesters,” said a highly placed party official.The party is expected to pitch CAA as a major issue in forthcoming elections, not the least because its opponents in Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Kerala have been aggressively adversarial towards the law.“Support for CAA is widespread and growing, and will help in framing future battles as contests over the issue of whether India should provide citizenship to Hindus and other religious minorities who have been victims of persecution in neighbouring Islamic countries,” the official said.The fog of confusion created by disinformation and shrewd tactics like the display of Constitution has been cleared and now people have clarity about the religious nature of protests like the one at Shaheen Bagh and that is going to help,” the official added.In Bihar, BJP may have to contend with its ally, CM and JD(U) boss Nitish Kumar, who would like to campaign on the governance plank which he has sought to strengthen by working hard to reach piped water to every household and with an ambitious campaign to renew water bodies.Sources in the BJP acknowledged that while Kumar has supported CAA, he may not share their enthusiasm about the law. But that may not stop CAA from becoming a major issue in the election because of the vehemence with which RJD has opposed the law. “In any case, BJP will be running its own campaign in the seats it will contest,” said one of them.
