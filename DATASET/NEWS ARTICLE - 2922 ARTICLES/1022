Neon has acquired the North American rights to the romantic drama “Ammonite,” starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan, the distributor announced Saturday.

The deal may have taken place during Sundance, but it’s currently in post-production and isn’t playing in Park City. Francis Lee wrote and directed the film that is produced by See-Saw Films and is inspired by the life of Victorian-era fossilist Mary Anning, played by Winslet.

The story is set in 1840s England and revolves around the intense relationship between the infamous fossil hunter and a young woman (Ronan) sent to convalesce by the sea.

See-Saw Films developed the project with BBC Films and the BFI (awarding lottery funding). See-Saw’s Iain Canning and Emile Sherman produced alongside Fodhla Cronin O’Reilly, with Simon Gillis (See-Saw’s COO of film), Mary Burke, Rose Garnett and Zygi Kamasa all executive producing.

Ronan was just nominated for an Oscar for “Little Women,” and she’ll next be seen in Wes Anderson’s “The French Dispatch.” Ronan is represented by CAA, Derik Mulvey and Relevant.

Winslet is playing the title role in HBO’s “Mare of Easttown” and is also an executive producer on the show.

The deal was negotiated with NEON by CAA Media Finance and Cross City Films, See-Saw’s in-house sales arm. Cross City Films sold international rights at the European Film Market in Berlin.

Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions already acquired international distribution rights on the unfinished drama.

Deadline first reported the news of the sale.
