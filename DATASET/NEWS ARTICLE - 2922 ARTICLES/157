On a day the BJP faced a drubbing in the Delhi Assembly elections, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar wrote to all his ministerial colleagues to spread the word about public welfare efforts undertaken by the Central government. The new campaign has been named ‘Har Kaam Desh Ke Naam’ (Every work dedicated to the nation).

In a letter dated February 11, Javadekar wrote: “I want to bring to your attention that from February 15, 2020 to March 31, 2020, it is required to publicise the public welfare works of this government through television, newspapers, outdoor (advertisements) and through the digital medium. Hence, this is to request you to prepare a campaign on those programmes of your ministry that will benefit the public. This time, the advertisements will be broadcast on the theme ‘Har Kaam Desh Ke Naam’”.

The move comes amid widespread protests against the CAA and nationwide NRC and follows a string of less than satisfactory performances in state elections since the party’s thumping 303 tally in the Lok Sabha elections in May last year.

In his letter, Javdekar also said campaigns must be finalised and released as soon as possible, and information about the same shared with the information and broadcasting ministry.

“Campaigns such as this are periodically undertaken. We have done it in the past with the ‘Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat’ campaign or the ‘Namumkin ab mumkin hai’ campaign. Remember the ‘ Bharat Nirman’ campaign of the UPA government or even the ‘India Shining’ campaign of the earlier NDA government. Such campaigns are undertaken by all governments and have nothing to do with the outcome of elections,” an official said.

The India Shining and the Mumkin Hai campaigns though were launched in the runup to the Lok Sabha elections of 2004 and 2019 respectively, albeit with very different results. The latter had drawn flak because of its similarity with the BJP tagline in 2019 “Modi hai to Mumkin hai”.
