BJP’s bet on Shaheen Bagh doesn’t seem to have paid off as the party looks to finish a distant second in the Delhi Assembly elections 2020. However, it has put up a better show than it did in 2015, leading in 12 seats in the 70-member House at 12.30 pm. In the last election, the party had managed to win only three seats, while the AAP bagged the rest 67 seats.

BJP’s candidate with the highest margin at this moment is Jagdish Pradhan, who is leading by over 26,500 votes from the Mustafabad seat. AAP’s Haji Yunus trails.

The closest fight, meanwhile, is between BJP’s Sanjay Goyal and AAP’s Ram Niwas Goel from the Shahdara seat. The difference is 678 votes.

We are coming to power in Delhi today. Don’t be surprised if we win 55 seats,” he said this morning, reported news agency PTI.

Up against the Aam Aadmi Party’s projection of health, education, and power etc, the BJP led a vitriolic campaign with some of its party leaders resorting to hate speech.
