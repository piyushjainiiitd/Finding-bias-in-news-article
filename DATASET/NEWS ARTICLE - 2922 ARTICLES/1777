The briefing comes a day after pollsters predicted a comfortable position indicating return to power for the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the national capital. Earlier today, the Delhi Chief Minister was irked by the polling authority’s delay in releasing the final voter turnout, wrote on Twitter, it was ‘shocking’ that the body could not come up with the figures even ‘several hours’ after voting concluded. Lashing out at the EC on Twitter, the Aam Aadmi Party chief said, “Absolutely shocking. What is EC doing? Why are they not releasing poll turnout figures, several hours after polling?”

While, pollsters predicted a 50-plus seat share in the 70-seat Assembly for AAP, the BJP is expected to improve its tally by winning at least 20 seats, while the Congress is likely to draw a blank. In the last two Assembly polls that the AAP contested in 2013 and 2015, the constituencies in the city — Deoli, Ambedkar Nagar, Seemapuri, Sangam Vihar — have shown the way for the party in terms of numbers and also voter percentages.
