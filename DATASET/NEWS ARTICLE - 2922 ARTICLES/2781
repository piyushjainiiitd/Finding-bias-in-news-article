Delhiâ€™s Shaheen Bagh has become the epicentre of protests against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act. People from various walks of life have expressed their solidarity with the protesters, who are on a sit-in for over 50 days against the new citizenship law. On Tuesday, popular singer Shubha Mudgal performed at the venue. A short clip of her performance has now gone viral on social media.

Since being shared online, the 20-second clip has been viewed over 43,000 times and prompted many reactions. Mudgalâ€™s performance comes days after several Indian comedians organised a charity show in Mumbai, extending support to the nation-wide protests.
