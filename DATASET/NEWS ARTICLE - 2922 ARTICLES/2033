William “World Wide Wes” Wesley is “under strong consideration” to join the basketball operations structure, per Ian Begley of SNY. Wesley and Rose are close and work alongside each other at the Creative Artists Agency (CAA).

The Knicks are going the route of the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers by placing a top agent with ties to some of the NBA’s best stars in executive roles. Rose’s clients include Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Carmelo Anthony.

Prior to firing Mills, Knicks owner Steve Dolan began considering and planning to hire a president from the player agent pool, Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne reported for ESPN. More formal negotiations are expected to happen after the NBA trade deadline passes at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, ESPN reported.

Mills was fired after working for Dolan since 2013. He was promoted to president in June 2017 after the team let go of Phil Jackson. The team named general manager Scott Perry as the interim leader of basketball operations.

At the time of the firing, Dolan reportedly had his eyes on Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri, though Ujiri’s contract and the Knicks’ reluctance to give up draft picks for him caused issues.
