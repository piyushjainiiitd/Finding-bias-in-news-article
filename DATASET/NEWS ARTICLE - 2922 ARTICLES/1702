New Delhi: The Indian national flag was unfurled by the protesters at Shaheen Bagh in the national capital on the occasion of 71st Republic Day on Sunday. In the wee hours today, protestors demonstrating against the amended citizenship law sung the national anthem and read the preamble of the Constitution.

Protests have been going on at Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi for over a month against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Meanwhile, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court last week seeking appropriate directions to the police to open Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which has been closed since 15 December due to ongoing protests against the CAA.
