Lucknow: Attacking the all women-led protests taking place in parts of the country, UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that the opposition parties and detractors of the government are now bringing the women out on the streets while the "men of the house remain asleep in the comfort of a blanket.""This is such a grave offence that the man of the house is sleeping at home under a blanket and women are out on the streets ... it is utterly shameful for Congress, SP and other parties.""Now they don't even have the courage to protest themselves ... because they know that if they resort to arson and damage to public property their own property will be seized , so they have started positioning the women and children of the house on the streets," said Adityanath.Fore more than a month now peaceful sit-ins comprising women of all ages and backgrounds have been going on in the national capital's Shaheen Bagh area. Following suit, a large group of women in Lucknow too have started peaceful protests against the legislation as well as in solidarity with the Shaheen Bagh women. This has not gone down well with the government. In Lucknow, FIRs against three women had also been filed by the UP Police. Adityanath also raised a question on the awareness of the women who are participating in such protests."The women who are sitting in protest don't even know what CAA is . If you ask the why are they protesting, they will tell you that the man of the house has said that we have become incapable to do anything so it is better that you go out and protest," he said.
