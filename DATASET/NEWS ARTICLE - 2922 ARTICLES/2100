The powerful rendition of both poems is getting much love online. The powerful rendition of both poems is getting much love online.

Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s iconic anti-establishment poem Hum Dekhenge has struck a chord with the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters across the country. The 1979 poem by the Pakistani poet is being sung at almost all the protests, which began after Parliament passed the contentious act. Apart from this, Rabindranath Tagore’s famous poem ‘Where the mind is without fear’ also features in the anti-CAA slogans.

Recently, Sufi singer and composer Sonam Kalra sang a soulful rendition of Hum Dekhenge and merged it with Dastango Sunil Mehra’s rousing recitation of Tagore’s ‘Where the mind is without fear’.

In a powerful video, Kalra, who was behind the project, blended the worlds of Faiz and Tagore, to put forward the message of universal freedom and peace.

With Manish Sahriya’s melodic musical arrangement and Innee Singh’s cinematography, Kalra collaborated with three other artistes to create an everlasting and powerful celebration of two great poets known for defiance and resilience.

The video not only got a nod from poetry lovers in the country but from across the border as well.
