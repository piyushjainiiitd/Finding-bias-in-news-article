Opposition MLAs held up placards and shouted slogans in the Uttar Pradesh assembly on the first day of the budget session on Thursday, also interrupting the Governor's speech over the citizenship law CAA, law and order, jobs and rising prices of LPG or cooking gas.

As soon as Governor Anandiben Patel rose to make her speech, MLAs, mostly those of the Samajwadi Party wearing crimson caps, marched to the centre of the house and protested, some sitting down. Many of them held up placards targeting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which have caused nationwide protests with critics and activists alleging they are tools to target Muslims.

Some MLAs carried LPG or cooking gas cylinders on their back.
