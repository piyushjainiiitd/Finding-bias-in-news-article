NEW DELHI: Outgoing British high commissioner Dominic Asquith Thursday expressed hope the Indian government will continue to address the CAA-related issues in the spirit of its manifesto commitment of “with all, development for all and trust of all”. He also said that even after Brexit, UK will remain India’s most important European partner and that the two sides will see expansion of trade diplomatic and security activities.“There is protest in every single democracy. I refer back to the ‘with all, development for all, and trust of all (sabka saath, sabka vikas , sabka vishwas)’ as the objective set by this government and I am sure that in that ‘trust of all’ (is) the trust that it will be addressing the concerns that have been expressed about the CAA. But that is for the Indian government to deal with,” he said.He also said the British side had not received any proposal from India to visit J&K following the repeal of Article 370 and that UK diplomats remained willing to visit J&K. Briefing the media, he also expressed regret over threats that, he said, Indian high commission may have felt because of violent protests on its premises. “I am glad to note that the last two protests have passed off without serious concern. That balance between the right to protest and ensuring that they don’t cross the line to illegality is a balance that is always difficult to maintain,” he said, adding that Metropolitan Police has the responsibility to do so.On the anti-CAA resolutions in the European parliament, he said that parliaments as key democratic institutions have the habit to debate a variety of subjects.
