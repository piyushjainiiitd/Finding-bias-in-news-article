Leon Rose still has stuff to do.

Rose, the former superagent for Creative Artists Agency, won’t be introduced as the Knicks president until after the All-Star break.

According to multiple sources, decertifying as an agent with the Players Association is just an excuse for the delay. That procedure only takes a day.

According to sources, the real issue is tying up loose ends at Creative Artists Agency and finding new agents for his many clients, preferably with CAA.

Another factor, according to sources, is the matter of settling up all the financial compensation he is due from the complicated network of CAA.

It is believed Rose had roughly 18 clients when he verbally agreed to take the Knicks president position last week, so he’s in the process of finding agents for players such as Carmelo Anthony, Karl-Anthony Towns, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Jaren Jackson, Collin Sexton, Jalen Brunson and Kyle Kuzma, among others.

Rose is expected to be in Chicago during All-Star Weekend as is Knicks owner James Dolan, who runs the league’s annual tech summit and fired Steve Mills nine days ago to create the opening Rose will fill.

Moe Harkless, obtained last week from the Clippers in the Marcus Morris trade, made his Knicks debut Wednesday after overcoming a sickness and scored four points in 24 minutes.

The Queens native admitted one factor in attending St. John’s was to play at the Garden.

Nevertheless, a report had Harkless looking into a buyout in late February.

“I haven’t put any thought into it,” Harkless said. “I’ve been hearing about it, but it’s not my thought when I got traded here. I’m just in the moment.’’

For the first time this season, every player on the 15-man roster was healthy as Allonzo Trier and Damyean Dotson returned from illnesses.
