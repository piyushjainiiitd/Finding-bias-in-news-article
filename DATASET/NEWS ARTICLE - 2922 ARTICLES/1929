He said there is no provision in the amended law for taking anyone's citizenship away. "A canard is being spread against the CAA by the Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, and Trinamool Congress."

"The CAA is a law to grant citizenship," the home minister said.

"I want to say that irrespective of the protests this will not be withdrawn," he added.

Shah challenged Congress opposition leaders to hold a discussion with him on the CAA at a public forum.

He named Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav, Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee while throwing the "challenge".

"Congress has become blind due to vote bank politics,"he said. He also blamed the Congress for Partition.
