New Delhi: The Union budget has made a four-fold increase in payments to states for the implementation of central laws such as Citizenship Act and Foreigners Act even as protests on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Population Register NPR ) continue throughout India, ET has learnt.The Union home ministry has allocated Rs 40 crore for setting up foreigners’ tribunals, holding centres and the identification and tracking of illegal migrants, for 2020-21. In 2019-20, only Rs 9 crore was given to state governments for administration of central laws in the revised estimates.“This year, the provision for administration of foreigners’ tribunals (FTs) in Assam was to be made, because of which a higher allocation was made. MHA has already given in-principle approval for setting up 1,000 FTs in Assam,” explained a home ministry official. The final National Register of Citizen ( NRC ) list in Assam excluded the names of over 19 lakh people.“Some functions of the central government under the Foreigners Act, 1946; The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; The Citizenship Act, 1955; and The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, have been entrusted to the state government and UTs with prior consent under Article 258 (power of the Union to confer powers on states in certain cases) and Article 239 (administration of Union territories) of the Constitution,” said a home ministry official, who did not wish to be identified.In Assam, the state government has set up six detention centres with aid from the home ministry and referred over 12,000 cases to foreigners’ tribunal from 2017-19. The number of those detained in holding centres over the past three years were 1,381,” MoS (home) Nityanand Rai had informed Parliament. A second MHA official told ET that they have been sending regular reminders to states and UTs to claim their expenditure incurred on implementation of central laws such as Citizenship Act following which several states have filed their claims, resulting in higher allocation.“It was observed that some states and UTs are irregular in sending their proposals for reimbursements. Other states do not send any claims while some states bunch the expenditure of a few years wherein reimbursement claims for small amounts are received piece-meal,” the official said. The West Bengal, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab governments have passed resolutions against CAA implementation and objected to certain provisions of NPR.The chief ministers of several states have argued that NPR would be the first step towards a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) under which many residents could be declared illegal migrants because of lack of proper documents.
