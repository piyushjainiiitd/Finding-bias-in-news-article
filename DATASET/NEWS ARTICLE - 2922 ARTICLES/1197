My apologies, but my write up somehow got deleted when trying to post from my computer so this one is gonna be a bit sloppy. Please be patient with me.

Team: Old Dominion University Monarchs

Old Dominion is 6-8 (4-2 MAC), their line up is very senior-laden with six and two grapplers being ranked. They have faced three, current top 25 programs in NC State, South Dakota State, and Minnesota. They have also wrestled against UVA, Missouri, and Rider. Unfortunately they have lost to all of these opponents.

Coach: Steve Martin

Coach Martin was a three time state champion of Kempsville High school, from 1985-1987. He then went on to wrestle for the University of Iowa from 1988-1991, helping them win two team NCAA championships and earning All-American status in 1991 at 118lbs.

For coaching, Steve Martin guided Great Bridge High School to 13 state wrestling championships. He has been the head coach for ODU for the past 16 years. Helping them move from the CAA to the MAC in 2014, producing 10 All-Americans, and having a D1 coaching record of 162-118-3 for the Monarchs.

Line Up

125lbs: #20 Killian Cardinale (r-SO, Bristow VA)

133lbs: Shannon Hanna (FR, Lakeland FL)

141lbs: Sa'Derian Perry (r-SR, Lakeland FL)

149lbs: Kenan Carter (r-SR, Aurora IL)

157lbs: #7 Larry Early (r-SR, Oak Park, IL)

165lbs: Shane Jones (r-SR, Shroudsburg, PA)

174lbs: Alex Cramer (FR, Grayslake IL)

184lbs: Antonio Agee (SR, Haysfield VA)

197lbs: Timothy Young (r-SR, Aurora IL)

HVY: Will Hilliard (r-JR, Phoenix, NY)

Cardinale was the former 133lber but moved down to 125lbs (his preferred weight) due to the injury of star wrestler Michael McGee. This has also forced true freshman Shannon Hanna to start at 133lbs.

141lber Sa'Darian Perry is a fringe ranked wrestler who is actually a transfer from Eastern Michigan Univeristy and an All American. 149lbs Kenan Carter returns to the starting line up he lost last year.

ODUs best wrestler, Larry Early, is at 157lbs and is looking to add another All American status. 165lbs Shane Jones is still hunting for his first NCAA appearance and 174lbs Alex Kramer is starting his first collegiate season.

184lbs Antonio Agee is returning from an injury he sustain in last years MAC tournament. Timothy Young is a junior college transfer while 285lbs Will Hilliard is taking over for Ali Wahab.

Predictions

125: #20 Cardinale dec. #13 Prata (0-3 ODU)

133: Gerardi dec. Hanna (3-3 tie)

141: #18 Moore dec. Perry (6-3 VT)

149: Andonian dec. Carter (9-3 VT)

157: #7 Early dec. #18 LaPrade (9-6 VT)

165: #5 McFadden dec. Jones (12-6 VT)

174: Hughes dec. Cramer (15-6 VT)

184: #2 Bolen maj. dec. Agee (19-6 VT)

197: Young dec. Smeltzer (19-6 VT

285: Borst dec. Hilliard (22-9 VT)

Virginia Tech had wrestled the Monarchs last year at the Virginia duals. Prata was pinned by McGee and Cardinale lost to Korbin Meyers by decision. Sa'Darian Perry beat Moore in a close 3-2 match. But the bout of the dual was LaPrade stunning a then ranked #5 Early 8-4.

Virginia Tech should handle this team. There are three toss up matches to watch. Prata/Cardinale is between two ranked, but not overly skilled grapplers. Moore/Perry are both low scoring guys, so let's hope Mitch gets his revenge. And lastly Hughes is gonna be in a tight match against Kramer.
