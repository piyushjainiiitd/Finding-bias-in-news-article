New Delhi: Congress party Chief Sonia Gandhi was admitted to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Sunday after she complained of uneasiness and stomachache.

Officials at the Ganga Ram Hospital said Gandhi was taken to the hospital at around 7 pm and she was accompanied by her children Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi.

â€œSonia Gandhi will undergo some routine tests at the hospital. She is suffering a stomach ache. She may be discharged soon," said an official at the hospital.

Gandhi did not attend the Union budget presentation in Parliament on Saturday. She had attended first day of budget session on Friday and led party's protests against controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the Parliament premises.

While Congress officially did not issue any statement on her health till late Sunday evening a senior party leader said there was nothing worrying. "She had complained of a minor stomach ache and had to go for some routine checkups. There is nothing worrying," the party leader quoted above said requesting anonymity.

Gandhi had returned to the top post in the party in August last year after a gap of nearly 20 months after Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post taking accountability of party's defeat in Lok Sabha polls.

Gandhi in 2011 underwent a successful treatment for an ailment in the US and she also visits the country for regular check ups.
