Creative Artists Agency will replace its management structure with a new 11-member group called the CAA Board, it announced on Tuesday. The CAA Board will oversee the day-to-day management of the global talent agency.

The board’s members consist of leadership members in multiple CAA divisions, all of whom will continue in their previous roles while serving on the board. The members are Michael Levine and Paul Danforth from CAA Sports, Maha Dakhil and Joel Lubin from the Motion Pictures division, Emma Banks and Rick Roskin from the Music division, Joe Cohen and Tiffany Ward from the Television division, and the agency’s Chief Innovation Officer Michelle Kydd Lee.

The board will report to CAA co-chairmen Richard Lovett, Bryan Lourd and Kevin Huvane and oversee several ventures including CAA Sports, CAA China, and the agency’s investment bank Evolution Media Capital.

“This is an exciting and important moment for our company,” Lovett said in a statement. “The members of the new agency Board have distinguished themselves in our highest priorities – embracing our culture and working in support of colleagues, while also succeeding in our company’s mission to be the best in the world in creating opportunities for and serving our clients. This new group will build upon our tremendous momentum and accelerate the agency’s growth, through laser-focused ways in which we can support our clients’ goals and aspirations.”
