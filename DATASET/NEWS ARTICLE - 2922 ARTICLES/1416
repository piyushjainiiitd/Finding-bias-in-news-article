Krishnanagar: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday described the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a party of "fekus" (those who bluff) who threaten people with guns and bullets to divide the country on the basis of religion.

Without naming Union minister Anurag Thakur or his "shoot the traitors remark", Banerjee, who was speaking at a convention of TMC workers at Krishnagar in Nadia district, questioned how a central minister continues in a constitutional post despite speaking unconstitutionally.

The Trinamool Congress supremo also slammed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for his "goli vs boli" comment.

She said, "BJP is a feku party. It is only interested in giving out fake news. It is trying to divide the country on the basis of religion and are threatening people with guns and bullets".

"I was born in Hindustan, not in a nation governed by BJP who attack people with guns and bullets," she added.

The TMC supremo also criticised the BJP-led government at the Centre for destroying the harmony in the country by forcibly trying to implement the CAA, the NPR and the NRC.
