The incident on Sunday night triggered panic in the area. A police vehicle had reached the spot after the incident but was chased away by angry students.

Hundreds of students and locals gathered outside the university. Many raised slogans against the Delhi Police. They also staged a dharna outside the Jamia Nagar police station.

Shezad Ahmed, a Jamia Millia Islamia student and resident of Zakir Nagar, said they were not even allowed to protest peacefully. "We are not going to be deterred by such incidents. We will continue with our protest," he added.
