A recap of today's SC hearing on CAA:

- The Supreme Court Wednesday refused to stay the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) until it heard the Centreâ€™s response.

- A three-judge bench headed by CJI S A Bobde, which was hearing a batch of 143 pleas, granted the Centre four weeks to reply.

- A 3-judge bench to sit in the 5th week for fixing schedule, while a 5-judge bench to sit subsequently for interim relief, merit.

- The apex court also said that Assam and Tripura matters will be clubbed together to be dealt with separately. The Court asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal to assist in identifying these matters.

- The Supreme Court also restrains all other high courts from passing any order on CAA.

- During the hearing, Attorney General KK Venugopal arguing for the Centre said the government had been given copies of only 60 of 143 pleas and hence required more time to respond. At one point, CJI Bobde said the court may refer the matter to a Constitution Bench.

- senior advocates AM Singhvi, Kapil Sibal appearing for the petitioners requested the court to put on hold operation of CAA and postpone the exercise of NPR for the time being.
