New Delhi: The Citizenship Amendment Act was meant to correct “historical injustice” done to minorities from neighbouring countries and to fulfil the country’s “old promise”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said. Addressing a contingent of National Cadet Corps (NCC) in New Delhi on Tuesday Modi said: “I am amazed how people can forget Gandhiji’s promise to minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”“We know the neighbouring country has lost three wars. Our military has the ability to defeat it in a few days. Hence, Pakistan has been carrying out a proxy war which has martyred thousands of people and soldiers,” he said. “When our military asked for action, previous governments denied it,” he alleged. “But, we have carried out surgical and aerial attacks.”Since Independence a few political parties ignored the problems in Jammu and Kashmir and left ‘terrorism thriving’ in the Valley. “Terrorism, naxalism, secessionism and corruption were kept alive for vote-bank politics,” Modi alleged. His government was ready to resolve the country’s persisting problems which were ‘ignored’ for the last seven decades, he said.“Three families in Jammu and Kashmir and a few political parties ignored problems in Jammu and Kashmir and lakhs of people and security personnel died. Lakhs of people were thrown out of their houses one night. Should we allow such things in Kashmir?” Modi said, adding that Article 370 was a temporary clause and he failed to understand why it was not removed.“Was it because of vote-bank politics? When the government brought the Citizenship Amendment Act, the same set of political parties are busy with vote-bank politics. Are they not aware of what is happening in Pakistan?”Modi alleged that his political rivals propagated a ‘false narrative’ but he would face criticism and ‘abuses bravely’. The government resolved issues of militancy in the northeast by bringing all stakeholders together, he said citing the Bodo agreement.
