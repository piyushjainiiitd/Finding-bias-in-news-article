Mumbai, January 25

The Shiv Sena on Saturday called for the deportation of illegal Muslim migrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh even as it found fault with the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The remarks came in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamna that ranted at Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Raj Thackeray who has now adopted a hardline Hindutva stand.

“There is no doubt that Muslim infiltrators from Pakistan and Bangladesh have to be thrown out of the country, but is it necessary for you to change your party’s flag for the purpose,” Saamna asked referring to the new saffron flag unveiled by MNS.

The write-up stated that the Shiv Sena has never changed the colour of its flag. “The Shiv Sena’s flag .... will always remain saffron. It has always fought for Hindutva,” Saamna said. The editorial then criticised the CAA saying it had several loopholes.

The newspaper said Raj Thackeray had earlier opposed the CAA but has now become its supporter. “Yesterday he said the MNS would take out a morcha in support of CAA … but one month ago Shri Raj Thackeray had opposed the law. He had said that Amit Shah brought the law to divert the attention of the people from inflation and unemployment,” Saamna said.
