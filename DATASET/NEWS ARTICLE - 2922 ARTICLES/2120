New Delhi: Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday alleged that Delhi's Shaheen Bagh protest is emerging as a textbook example of how a few hundred people are suppressing the silent majority. He claimed that those trying to fragment India are getting cover at Shaheen Bagh.“It is offering platform to ‘ tukde tukde gang’ elements under the garb of opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. This protest is not just a protest against CAA ,it is a protest against Modi,” Prasad said in a press conference.“Lakhs of people are distressed because they cannot go to office, shops are shut and their children are not able to go to school due to road block by Shaheen Bagh protesters,” he said.Prasad also accused AAP government in Delhi to be hand in gloves with protestors.“The millions who're silent, but are in trouble with these protests, also have their right to freedom of speech and expression. Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia stand with protestors,” he added.Prasad also took on Congress and said that both Rahul Gandhi and Arvind kejriwal are silent on the issue.Union minister once again clarified that CAA is not a law to remove citizenship from anyone. “We have always said that in India, respect is there for everyone. Every minority is respected. We are proud of Kalam, Abul Kalam Azad, Abdul Hamid, Asfaqullah Khan, and other such brave-hearts,” he added.
