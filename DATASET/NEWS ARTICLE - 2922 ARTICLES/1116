Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay

MUMBAI: The protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) divided the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, campus as it polled for annual elections on Sunday. Graduate and undergraduate students picked their general secretary for academic affairs, cultural, sports and hostel affairs amid controversies and complaints.Ahead of the voting, a social media post that urged students not to vote for a candidate because he was found sloganeering at an anti-CAA protest created a stir. The post, which read: "He is a candidate, think twice before voting" was accompanied by a video from the December 19 protest at August Kranti Maidan which the candidate had participated in. The social media campaigns also named another candidate.The candidate in the video refused to comment, but a close friend said, "The malicious content and intent has distressed the candidate and he suffered an anxiety attack and may seek help from counsellors. He believes in the Constitution and has been passionate about social work. Looking at such a hate campaign against him, his family is also under stress." Candidates contesting against him refused to comment.Some students also urged others to opt for NOTA. Condemning the influence of external groups on the institute's elections, a Facebook post said, "We absolutely denigrate the targeting of our fellow students. No matter what the debate within our campus is, the calling out of a student within our campus as a seditious individual by organizations outside our campus is horrifying."While authorities from IIT Bombay refused to comment, members of the election commission said they would look into the complaints.
