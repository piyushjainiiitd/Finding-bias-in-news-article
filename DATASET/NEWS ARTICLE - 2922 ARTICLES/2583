The Congress on Monday approached the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to demand action against Uttar Pradesh police officials who allegedly committed atrocities on people protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), with former party chief Rahul Gandhi accusing the State government of going to war against its own people.

The delegation, led by Mr. Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, submitted a detailed 31-page memorandum, including video clips and photographs as “evidence of atrocities” and human rights violations by U.P. police officials against whom no official complaint has been registered.

“The NHRC must act decisively to protect the idea of India & the Constitutional rights of our citizens,” Mr. Gandhi said in a tweet.

In the memorandum to the NHRC, the party alleged that the BJP government in the State “treats its own citizens like criminals”.

‘Reckless government’

“Given the role of a reckless State government that views the law and Constitution as mere inconveniences, the duty of institutions such as the NHRC to act as checks and balances and to embody and protect the values enshrined in the Constitution of India becomes paramount,” the Congress memorandum said.

The party argued that the NHRC has always stood tall with its glorious history when other institutions have fallen short.

Citing testimonies by witnesses, videos and ‘unbiased’ media reports, the Congress accused the U.P. police of destroying public and private property.
