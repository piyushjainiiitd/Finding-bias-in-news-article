NEW DELHI: Taking note of complaints of viral videos showing children participating in protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act at Shaheen Bagh in the national capital, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has written to the district magistrate (southeast Delhi) expressing apprehension that these children may be brought under “influence of miscommunication that may result in mental trauma”.The body has asked the DM to issue directions to the authorities concerned to identify the children and arrange for their counselling. NCPCR has sought a report within 10 days.The communication from NCPCR says that the commission has taken cognisance of a complaint. The complaint says that the “children are shouting that their elders have told them that Prime Minister and home minister will ask them to produce documents of citizenship and if they fail to produce, they will be sent to detention centres where they will not be allowed even food and clothing”.“It appears that these children might be brought under influence of rumours/miscommunication and as a result of which, they may suffer from mental trauma,” says the letter.In view of the “seriousness of the issue and its impact on children”, NCPCR asked the DM to issue necessary directions to district child protection officer along with police child welfare officer to identify these children and arrange counselling sessions for them and also for their parents, if deemed fit. “If required, children may be produced before the Child Welfare Committee also,” it said.NCPCR had in December issued an advisory to all directors general of police in states and Union Territories to take strict action against those found using children in unlawful activities like stone pelting and other violent acts during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.
