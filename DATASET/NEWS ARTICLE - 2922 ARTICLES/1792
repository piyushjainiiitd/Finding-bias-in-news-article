Orchard Park, N.Y. (WBEN) - NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he wants the Bills to remain in Buffalo during his annual State of the NFL address on Wednesday in Miami.

Goodell said he wants the Bills to remain competitive regarding stadium quality compared to other teams in the league and that discussions about an upgrade stadium or a new one have been contemplated for decades in Buffalo.

"I expect it will continue to be a collaborative process between the public sector and the Bills," Goodell said. "We all want the Buffalo Bills to continue to be in Buffalo and to be successful [with> a stadium that is going to be competitive with other teams around the league. I think everyone's committed to that."

The current stadium lease ends after the 2022-2023 NFL season.
