MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has formed a two-member committee to probe the alleged cases of phone tapping of Opposition leaders. Home minister Anil Deshmukh said the committee comprising Shrikant Singh, additional chief secretary (home), and Amitesh Kumar, joint commissioner (intelligence), will submit a report within six weeks.Addressing a press conference, Deshmukh said the government has ordered an inquiry after it received complaints that several top senior Opposition leaders’ phones were tapped in the past year. The phone tapping/snooping was done before the parliamentary and assembly polls in the state by the erstwhile BJP government to snoop on rivals, Deshmukh said.The committee is likely to visit telecom companies to trace the digital footprint of the snooping done. According to a note circulated by the home minister, “The inquiry should cover not only the legal documentation but also take the support of technical experts to decipher if unofficial surveillance has been carried out by tracing the footprint in the servers of various telecom companies through physical verifications and visits”.Deshmukh said the inquiry would find out how and why home department officials had gone to Israel and bought the snooping software (Pegasus) and how it was ‘misused’.Differences on CAA Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP do not seem to be sharing the same views on the Citizenship Amendment Act. On Monday, Deshmukh said the state will not allow the implementation of the CAA, National Registry of Citizens (NRC) or National Population Register (NPR) in the state.
