"So far as NPR is concerned, the first thing to know is that no document is required to be shown. You give the information verbally....No document is asked for in the NPR. There is a misinformation campaign by the Congress (regarding NPR)."

While talking about protests in Delhi, including Shaheen Bagh, Shah said, "As far as protest is concerned, everybody has the right to do a peaceful protest and we acknowledge that right of the people."
