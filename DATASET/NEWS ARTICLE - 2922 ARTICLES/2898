Looks like the storm of National Register of Citizens (NRC)and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is not settling anytime soon. Many actors have already expressed their views against its implementation. One of them was Jaaved Jaaferi who raised his voice in the on-going anti-CAA protests across the country.Jaaved took to his social media handle to share his opinion against the bill. The actor who has facing severe objection and troll Jaaved was recently questioned by one of the users on, 'when he plans to move out of the country?' Slamming the troll, Jaaved replied, "YOUR nation??? Kab kharida aapne ma’m ?? Last time I read the constitution it spoke of democracy, equality and right to dissent... Wouldn’t know if you have made any changes privately though..kindly update"Not only this but he also went on to reply to another Twitter user who wrote, "Clap Mr Jaaved. How does it matter? Hope you are aware we are independent, sovereign Republic . Indians will do whatever that is in their interest & the nation"Responding to him, Jaaved said, "Sir if international perceptions of India don’t matter’ than why was respected PM travelling all over the world trying to convince them to invest in India? Am very much aware of what India is and what damage CAA combined with NRC can do to its constitutional foundation."In the meantime, a month ago, the actor announced that he is going to quit Twiter temporarily because of the constant trolls and hate that he has been receiving. "Can’t handle this trolling and hate.. going off social media till the situation improves.. hopefully..Inshallaah..#indiafirst #jaihind", he tweeted.
