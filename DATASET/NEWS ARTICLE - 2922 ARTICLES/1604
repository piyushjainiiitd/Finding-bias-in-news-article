The convoy of CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar was attacked on Wednesday evening, according to police. Kanhaiya Kumar is on a state-wide tour of Bihar campaigning against the CAA, NPR and NRC. The former JNU student leader escaped unhurt in the attack by a stone-pelting mob, though one of the vehicles in his convoy was damaged and its driver injured. "The convoy has left for its next destination. Investigations are on to identify and nab the culprits," Sudhir Kumar Porika, the SP of Special Task Force said about the attack, which happens to be the second such incident in less than a week. On February 1, his convoy was attacked in Saran district.
