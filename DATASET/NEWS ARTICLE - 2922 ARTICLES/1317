LUCKNOW: No one will be pressured during the enumeration process of the National Population Register NPR ), senior BJP leader Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday.“If any government official, during the NPR exercise, asks you for your name, address, date of birth, name of your father, when did you come…you won’t be pressurised to answer. Whatever you reveal will be noted down,” Singh said at a pro-CAA BJP rally in Meerut.Rajnath Singh, also India’s defence minister, reiterated there was no discussion on NRC in the government. “There has been no discussion yet. But even if, hypothetically speaking, a country wants to build a National Register of Citizens , why should it be opposed? Should the country’s citizens not have a register of their own,” he asked.Backing NRC, Singh said NRC will help in transferring the benefits of the government’s welfare schemes directly to the people. “If we prepare a document like that, it will help us give you direct benefits...for example, subsidy for manure.”He said Congress was misguiding everyone and instilling a fear that if NPR was carried out, then NRC will follow and Muslims will be evicted from the country. “I want to assure Muslim citizens that nobody will dare lay a finger on you and if anyone has any complain, they can come to us, we will stand by that Muslim.”
