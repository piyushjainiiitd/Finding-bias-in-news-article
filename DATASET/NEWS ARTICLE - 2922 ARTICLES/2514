BJP ), who was in the Chair, directed that Maran's objectionable remarks be expunged from the records."We respect all languages. The remarks made against Sanskrit were condemnable and indecent," Thakur said.During the discussion, Maran said that "savings were part of our blood" but the government was discouraging it "by reducing the interest rates on savings".He also alleged that the "mistakes made by you (government) have come to haunt us", and asked "why can't you (government) come up with a single tax system?"Opposing government's plan to privatise Air India, he said that it was an Air India aircraft which went to China -- in the grip of a coronavirus outbreak-- to evacuate Indian students from there.He also made reference to the CAA , NRC and NPR and stated that Tamil Nadu was the first to raise voice against the issues and accused the central government of dividing the country.Referring to Aadhar, he said that "when you have dynamic data with you, why do you want to go for NPR".
