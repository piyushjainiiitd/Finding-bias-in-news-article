KOLKATA: The West Bengal assembly on Monday passed a resolution against “the interrelated” CAA NRC and NPR, becoming the fourth state after Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan to make the move.Congress and Left Front added muscle to Trinamool Congress’s opposition and the single BJP MLA present in the assembly was the lone voice of dissent.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee called the CAA a law that is “a shame to humanity and civilisation” and sought its immediate withdrawal.The resolution found “giving citizenship on the basis of religion and community” as “against the multifaceted democratic structure of the country”. “So this assembly, through the state government, wants to appeal to the Centre to repeal CAA… and withdraw the interrelated NRC and NPR,” it said.Accusing BJP of trying to divide India on the basis of religion and spreading intolerance and hatred, Mamata said CAA is not only anti-people but also goes against the spirit of the Constitution. “BJP may have numbers but that does not give it the right to mould the country according to its agenda,” she said. “We want CAA to be repealed and will not allow NRC or NPR to be implemented in this country. We have already stopped NPR work,” she said.
