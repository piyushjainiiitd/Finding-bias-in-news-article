The Delhi assembly election is around the corner, on February 8, and BJP hasn’t tasted success here since 1993. In pole position is incumbent AAP, but BJP has fielded nonentity Sunil Yadav against AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. So what is the BJP’s game plan?

Certainly the capital has plenty of civic woes that the opposition can capitalize on – from an annual crisis of winter air pollution and chronic garbage affliction to shortage of public buses and lack of women’s safety. On all these fronts the AAP government can be put on the mat for poor leadership. These are also issues intimately felt in citizens’ everyday lives. But in a queer choice, BJP seems to be plumping the Pakistan card instead.

BJP’s Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra, who has been seen sloganeering “desh ke gaddaaron ko, goli maaron saalon ko” in pro-CAA protests, has now declared that on February 8 “there will be a contest on Delhi roads between India and Pakistan.” Union home minister and former BJP chief Amit Shah has kicked off his poll campaign in Delhi by clubbing both Kerjriwal and Congress’s Rahul Gandhi with Pakistan PM Imran Khan: “They speak in the same tune. What relationship do they share?”

The claim that those who are questioning the Centre’s policies are being treasonous is untenable. Rather, as former President Pranab Mukherjee said yesterday, “Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent.” BJP should challenge AAP’s policies and governance report card. It should offer better alternatives. That’s the kind of political competition that delivers growth and development. Communal dog-whistles will only pull us all down a septic rabbit hole.
