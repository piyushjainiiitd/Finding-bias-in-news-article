Thank you Delhi for standing up to protect the soul of India! — Prashant Kishor (@PrashantKishor) 1581402535000

New Delhi: The Delhi election results came as a major boost to election strategist Prashant Kishor , who had joined hands with the Aam Aadmi Party in December last year for managing its campaign.After the results came in on Tuesday, Kishor took to microblogging site Twitter to say, “Thank you Delhi for standing up to protect the soul of India.”On January 28, Kishor was ousted from the JD(U), a BJP ally, for his stand on Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. He had openly criticised the central government for CAA and NRC But Kishor continued to be in demand as a poll strategist. On February 2, DMK leader MK Stalin announced his association with Kishor’s company, Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC), IPAC for campaign management. Kishor is also working with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for 2021 assembly polls.“IPAC will keep working in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. But before that there is Bihar election this year,” Kishor told ET. “On February 18 I will do a press conference in Patna to reveal my further plan for the state.”While Kishor did not elaborate on his plans, people close to him told ET that he will play an active role in the Bihar election as a politician and not as a poll strategist. “He has plans for Bihar and two-three months from now things will be different in Bihar than they look now,” said one of his associates, who did not wish to be identified.
