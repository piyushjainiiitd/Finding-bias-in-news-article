Police said they had not granted permission for the programme to be held.

Azad’s detention comes days after he was released from Tihar prison in Delhi following his arrest for allegedly inciting people during an anti-CAA protest.

I am an inspector. I know law. Says @hydcitypolice to Sr Supreme Court lawyer as they detain @BhimArmyChief. This movement has been good in so many ways. We wouldn't have known that our police had become a ruling class of its own. More power to you Azad. pic.twitter.com/y0SEjGy4Rf — Kannan Gopinathan (@naukarshah) January 26, 2020
