The Los Angeles office of Creative Artists Agency was evacuated Wednesday afternoon due to a suspected gas leak, two individuals with knowledge of the situation told TheWrap.

According to a witness, a number of the buildingâ€™s employees were standing outside as security was sweeping the structure top to bottom. Another witness said there was an odor of gas, so the building was evacuated out of caution. The fire department investigated the scene before letting staff re-enter at around 3:40 p.m.

The CAA building is located at 2000 Avenue of the Stars in Century City.

TheWrap reached out to the Los Angeles Fire Department and the Police Department for further information about the incident but they have yet to respond.

In 2015, the building was evacuated after a bomb threat. A suspicious package had reportedly been found on the ninth floor of the building. However, LAPD officers at the scene stated that no bomb had been uncovered, but instead found a suspicious package containing an unknown liquid.

Earlier this month, the SAG-AFTRA offices in both Los Angeles and New York were also evacuated after a phone threat.
