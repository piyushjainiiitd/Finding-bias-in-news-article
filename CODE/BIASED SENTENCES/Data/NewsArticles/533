BJP leaders Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma have been removed by the Election Commission from the list of star campaigners for Delhi polls over their controversial remarks. An order issued by the poll body on Wednesday barred the two leaders who made objectionable comments while campaigning during election rallies. During an election rally, BJP leader and Union minister Thakur egged on the crowd to raise an incendiary slogan - "traitors should be shot at" - after he lashed out at anti-CAA protesters. West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma on Tuesday said what happened in Kashmir with Kashmiri Pandits could happen in Delhi, warning that lakhs of anti-CAA protesters in Shaheen Bagh could enter homes to kill and rape women.
