The Economist Intelligence Unit has been bringing out a global Democracy Index since 2006. In a worrying occurrence in 2019 not only has India dropped 10 places to the 51st spot, this is its worst performance to date. India’s “democratic regression” is on account of developments in J&K as well as on the CAA-NRC front. Moreover, all this is against the backdrop of a poor year for democracy in the world at large.

BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli has challenged the ranking as a “flawed conclusion based on some motivated inputs”, citing as counter the “raucous interaction of citizens of all political leanings on the social media”. What he should note is that were that “raucous interaction” to end India would drop from its present status as “flawed democracy” – it would not be a democracy any more.

Whether it is the unending detention of Kashmir’s top political leadership or the khaki clampdown on peaceful anti-CAA-NRC protests, there have been plenty of questions raised within the country on the state of civil liberties. The global Democracy Index is merely echoing these questions. They must not be summarily dismissed. India’s traditions of free and open debate must be cherished and protected. The chief minister of India’s largest state, Yogi Adityanath, declaring that “azaadi” chants will be treated as “deshdroh” signals intolerance to dissent. Do appreciate that such signals dispirit citizen even as they damage India’s soft power as a vibrant democracy. And India is not the US or China, that it can disregard world opinion and get by. Don’t shoot the messenger.
