Honor 9X review: Good specifications, but is the price right?

Honor 9X tries to impress with a pop-up selfie camera and tall display. The phone has 48MP triple rear cameras and packs a 4,000mAh battery. Priced starting at Rs 13,999, Honor 9X competes with Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro & Samsung Galaxy M30s.
