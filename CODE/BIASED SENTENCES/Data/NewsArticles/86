GUWAHATI: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Kokrajhar that there have been attempts to mislead the people of Assam and the northeast over the CAA, All Assam Students’ Union ( Aasu ) chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya hit back at the PM on Saturday by saying that people opposing CAA are more patriotic than those supporting the Act.Addressing an anti-CAA rally at Pathsala in lower Assam’s Barpeta district, Bhattacharyya said people voicing concern over CAA love their state and their nationalism and affection for the nation cannot be questioned.He added that the Centre cannot “bargain with anti-CAA agitators” by granting constitutional safeguards to the indigenous communities of Assam by implementing Clause 6 of the Assam Accord.On Saturday, Aasu and 30 other allied organisations took out torch rallies against CAA across district headquarters of the state. Significantly, AGP MLA and party vice-president Pabindra Kumar Deka also joined the protest rally.
