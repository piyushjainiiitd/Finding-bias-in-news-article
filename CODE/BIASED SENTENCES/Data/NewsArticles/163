On 30 January the Jewish “charity”, the Campaign Against Antisemitsm (CAA), declared that it would “be selecting a number of future dates on which to picket the 606 [jazz] club over its decision” to present a jazz performance by yours truly. With this threat, the CAA crossed the line. This time it wasn’t just going after me or my band, this time its threat was directed at an entire community of musicians and music lovers for whom the 606 club is a pre-eminent venue, and none of whom has anything to do with me or my ideas.

Such threats are anathema to British and Western values; the way to counter ideas with which they don’t agree is to present their own position. The tactic of gross intimidation, of menacing an entire community over the lawful speech of one member are more characteristic of organised crime than of a British charity.

On 2 February I reported the CAA’s actions to the police. They took my complaint very seriously and I was interviewed for two hours. I had the strong impression that the matter was already known to the police.

During the time the police interviewed me, I received a message that the CAA is under investigation by the Charities Commission.

I was advised that every musician, music venue, promoter or audience member who is or has been subject to any intimidation or harassment by the CAA should contact the police immediately.

No one should be harassed, especially by a “charity”, and I want to believe that the threats to British politicians, artists, intellectuals, journalists, venues and ordinary people are about to come to an end. Such a development would make life safer and more comfortable for Jews and gentiles alike.
