Indore BJP councillor Usman Patel on Saturday resigned from the party over the new citizenship law saying it discriminates against one community. He also accused the BJP of practising politics of hatred.

Talking to The Indian Express, the municipal councillor from Khajrana locality said it took him some time to quit because he wanted to understand legalities and finer points of law from advocates. However, he is now convinced that the law is against Muslims, he added.

While resigning from the primary membership of the party along with his supporters, Patel said he had joined the saffron party after being inspired by former prime minister and party stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

In the last few weeks, hundreds of members of the BJPâ€™s minority cell across Madhya Pradesh have resigned over the contentious citizenship law brought in by the government of India in December last year.
