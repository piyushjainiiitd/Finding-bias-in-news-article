Prime Minister Narendra Modi Assures in Lok Sabha that CAA will not Affect any Indian Citizen





Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today replied to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s Address.

Dwelling on length at the Citizenship Amendment Act, the Prime Minister assured the House that no citizen of India would be affected by it.

The Prime Minister in his speech referred to the thought process of the previous Governments which were on the same lines.

Shri Narendra Modi quoted the first Prime Minister of India Pt Jawaharlal Nehru who favoured amending the law, if required, to ensure that minority refugees from neighbouring countries be granted protection by India.

Prime Minister said that certain political parties are furthering Pakistan’s agenda of divisiveness in India and assured the Lok Sabha that the CAA is not going to affect any Indian Citizen.

“I want to clarify that there will be no impact on any citizen of India, whatever be their faith/religion, owing to the implementation of the CAA”, he said.

PM @narendramodi: Those who have been removed from office by the people of India are now doing the unthinkable. They see citizens on the basis of their faith.
