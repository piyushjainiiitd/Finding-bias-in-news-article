Hours after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal questioned the ‚Äúdelay‚Äù in the release of final voter turnout figures for the Assembly polls, the Election Commission Sunday said 62.59 per cent of the electorate exercised their franchise on February 8. This is significantly lower than 2015 when the turnout was 67.12 per cent.

Addressing a press conference, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh said returning officers were busy in scrutinising the data throughout the night to ensure its accuracy.

‚ÄúVoter turnout data is submitted by returning officers. The returning officers worked throughout the night to check data to ensure it is accurate,‚Äù Ranbir Singh said.

Earlier in the day, Kejriwal lashed out at the Election Commission over the delay in announcing the final voter turnout. The Aam Aadmi Party chief wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúAbsolutely shocking. What is EC doing? Why are they not releasing poll turnout figures, several hours after polling?‚Äù
