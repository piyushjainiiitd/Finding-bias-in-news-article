New Delhi: President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday emphasized on buying local products indicating that the government in its 2020-21 (April-March) Union Budget to be presented on Saturday may turn to Swadeshi.

“The fundamental mantra of independence was a self-reliant India. A self-reliant India is possible only when every Indian takes pride in every product made in India. My government believes in the mantra of ‘buy local for a better tomorrow’. I urge every representative of the people, from Panchayat level to the Parliament, and every Government in the country, to transform the philosophy of ‘buy local for a better tomorrow’ into a movement. I also urge every Indian to give priority to local products. By using locally manufactured products, you will be able to help the small entrepreneurs in your area to a great extent," Kovind said in his address to the joint sitting of Parliament at the beginning of the Budget session.

Faced with the falling fortunes of Indian exporters and rising imports, especially from its northern neighbour China, India has increasingly turned to import substitution by curbing what it calls non-essential imports. The commerce ministry has proposed to expand its scope further. It has asked the finance ministry to impose a border adjustment tax in the budget on certain imported goods to make up for non-refundable internal taxes like electricity duty, duties on fuel, clean energy cess, etc for exporters.

It has also proposed to put curbs on 200 non-essential items such as toys, furniture, plastic products and sports items. Trade minister Piyush Goyal has even threatened to restrict imports of around 3,000 uncategorized “others" items worth $140 billion in India’s import basket.
