On the eve of India’s 71st Republic Day, President Ram Nath Kovind Saturday urged the youth of the country to remain non-violent and remember Gandhi’s gift of “Ahimsa” (non-violence) when fighting for a cause.

“When fighting for a cause, people, particularly the youth, should not forget the gift of Ahimsa Gandhiji gave to humanity. Gandhiji’s talisman for deciding whether an act is right or wrong also applies to the functioning of our democracy,” the president said in his customary address to the nation on the eve of 71st Republic Day.

The President’s remarks come in the backdrop of country-wide protests against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and proposed nation-wide NRC, although the president made no direct reference to them.

“Unreserved praise for armed forces”

Speaking on the issue of security, President Kovind said that strong internal security is essential for the development of the country and therefore, the government has taken several steps to strengthen the internal security system.

“I have nothing but unreserved praise for our armed forces, paramilitary and internal security forces. Their sacrifices to preserve the integrity and unity of our country present a saga of unparalleled courage and discipline,” Kovind said.

In his concluding remarks, the President quoted the words of B R Ambedkar: “If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgment we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives”, adding that these words of Ambedkar have lit the path for the country and will continue to show us the way ahead.
