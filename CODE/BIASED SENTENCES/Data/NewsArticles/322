vote on a resolution

NEW DELHI: The EU Parliament should not take actions that call into question the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures, official sources said on Sunday ahead of aagainst India's new citizenship law.The government also called upon the sponsors and supporters of the resolution to engage with India to get a full assessment of the facts, official sources said."EU Parliament should not take action that call into question rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures," the sources said, adding that the matter is entirely internal to India.A resolution tabled by some EU members against India's Citizenship Amendment Act says that the law marks a “dangerous shift” in the country's citizenship regime.The European parliament is set to debate and vote on the resolution.It makes a reference to the Charter of the United Nations, Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as well as the India-EU Strategic Partnership Joint Action Plan signed in November 2005, and to the EU-India Thematic Dialogue on Human Rights as it urges the Indian authorities to "engage constructively" with those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and consider their demands to repeal the "discriminatory CAA"."The CAA marks a dangerous shift in the way citizenship will be determined in India and is set to create the largest statelessness crisis in the world and cause immense human suffering," it notes."Instead of addressing the concerns, offering corrective action, calling for security forces to act with restraint and ensuring accountability, many government leaders have been engaging in efforts to discredit, rebuke and threaten the protesters," the resolution states.The CAA came into force in India last December amid protests in India and around the world.
