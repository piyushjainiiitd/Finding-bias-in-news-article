Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was in Azamgarh on Wednesday and said 'we have to stand against injustice'. The Congress leader said: Wrong has been done with all of you, and we have to stand against this injustice. This govt is entirely against the poor people. Priyanka also met and interacted with protesters holding demonstration against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Relevantly, Priyanka's visit also comes in the backdrop of 'missing' posters of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav surfacing in his parliamentary constituency.
